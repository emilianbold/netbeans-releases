        <h2>Executing SQL Statements and Scripts</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You can use the SQL Editor to write and execute SQL statements and SQL scripts within the IDE.
        The SQL statement or script is executed on the database that is selected in the Connection drop-down menu in the toolbar.
        If the database connection is closed, the IDE opens the connection to the database.</p>
	<p>You can use the SQL Editor to create, edit and execute any SQL files in your project. 
	To open an SQL file, right-click the SQL file (&nbsp; <img src="images/sqlfile_icon.png" alt="SQL File">&nbsp;) in the Projects or Files window and choose Open.
	You can also double-click the icon to open the file in the SQL Editor.</p>
        
        
        <p><b>To create and execute a SQL statement or script:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Expand the Databases node in the Services window.</li>
            <li>Right-click the node for the connected database and choose Execute Command from the pop-up menu to open the SQL Editor.</li>
            <li>Make sure your current database connection is selected in the Connection drop-down menu. 
	    To see the status of the listed connections, click the Select Connection in Explorer button (&nbsp; <img src="images/showinexplorer.gif" alt="Select Connection in Explorer">&nbsp;) in the toolbar.
            When you click Select Connection in Explorer, the selected connection is highlighted in the Services window. </li>
            <li>Enter a (DDL or DML) statement in the SQL Editor window.</li>
            <li>Click Run SQL (&nbsp; <img src="images/runsql.png" alt="Run SQL">&nbsp;) to run the statement.</li> 
        </ol>
        <p>When you execute an SQL statement or script, the status of the SQL execution is displayed in the Output window.
        Any errors when executing the SQL statement or script are displayed in the Output window.</p>
        <p>When you execute an SQL statement, the output of the statement appears in the results pane in the lower half of the SQL Editor.
            If the statement has no output, the number of affected rows is displayed in the Output window of the IDE.</p>
        <p>You can access the Execute Command pop-up menu item from any subnode of a connected database (&nbsp;<img src="images/connection.gif" alt="Database Connection node">&nbsp;) in the Services window.</p>
