        <h2>Defining Database Explorer Debug Mode</h2>

        <p>Enable debug mode to see SQL statements that are being sent to the database.
        By default, debug mode is disabled. </p>
        <p><b>To enable debug mode:</b> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Services from the main menu to open the Services window.</li>
            <li>In the Services window, right-click the Databases node and choose Enable Debug.

                <p> Once debug mode is enabled, the IDE sends SQL statements to the Output window, 
                where you can view the log of statements. Debug mode does not list all SQL statements, 
                only those which you cannot see. For example, SQL queries for viewing data 
                are not logged. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>To disable debug mode:</b> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the Services window, right-click the Databases node and choose Disable Debug.</li>
        </ul>
