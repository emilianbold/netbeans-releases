        <h2>New Database Connection Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to supply the details to create a new database connection.

        You open this dialog box by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the Databases node in the Services window and choose New Connection.</li>
            <li>Right-click a driver node under the Databases node in the Services window and choose Connect Using.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Basic setting tab</b></p>
        <p>When you create a database connection, you supply the details needed to connect to a specific database.
        Depending on the database driver you are using, you need to supply some or all of the following database connection details. </p>
        <p><strong>Data Input Mode</strong></p>
        <p>There are two ways in which you can enter the URL of the database:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Field Entry.</b> When this radio button is selected, enter the information requested in each text field. </li>
        
     
<ul>
                <li><b>Driver Name.</b> Choose the registered JDBC driver from the drop-down list.
                The drop-down list only contains drivers registered with the IDE. 
                If your driver is not listed, you need to <a href="adddriver.html">add the JDBC driver</a> before
                you can connect to the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Host.</strong> Type the host for the database. Use <tt>localhost</tt> if the database is located on a local machine.</li>
                <li><strong>Port.</strong> Type the post to be used by the database connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Database</strong>. Type the name of the database.</li>
                <li><b>User Name.</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
                <li><b>Password.</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Display Name</strong> (optional). In this field, you can enter a display name for the new database connection that is convenient for you. </li>
                <li><b>Remember Password.</b> Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password.
                 If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
                  and the Remember Password property is set to True.
                 To set the Remember Password property to False, right-click the database connection node
                  in the Services window and choose Properties and modify the property in the Properties window.
                <ul class="note">
            <li>Storing a password represents a potential security risk.
            Connection passwords are stored in an xml file in the <tt>config/Databases/Connections</tt> directory in the IDE user dir.
            Passwords are scrambled but they are not encrypted.
            For more about securing database passwords, see the following  FAQ:
          <p>
              <p><object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                <param name="content" value="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/FaqSecuringDBConnectionPasswords">
                <param name="text" value="<html><u>How do I secure my database password?</u></html>">
                <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                <param name="textColor" value="blue">
                </object>
            </li></ul>
            <li><b>Show JDBC URL.</b> When you select this checkbox, the IDE displays the JDBC URL in the text field. This can be useful for identifying the database connection. Ths URL resembles ths following URL:
          <p><pre>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase</pre></p>
          </li>
          </ul>
    <li><b>Direct URL Entry.</b> When this radio button is selected, you enter the URL of the database directly. 
    <ul><li><b>Name:</b> Select the name of the driver from the drop down list.</li>
    <li><b>User Name:</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
    <li><b>Password:</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
    <li><b>JDBC URL.</b> Type the JDBC URL for the connection in this text field.</li>  
    </ul>
    </li></ul>
<p><b>Advanced tab</b></p>                 
In the Advanced tab of the New Database Connection dialog box, you select the database schema you want to use for your connection. The Database Explorer displays only tables that use the selected schema. 
<ul class="note">
  <li><b>Note: </b>The Advanced tab of the New Database Connection dialog box is enabled only if the database to which you want to connect contains existing schemas. Otherwise, the Advanced tab is grayed out. </li>

  <li><b>Note: </b>A schema does not appear in the Select Schema drop down list until you first create an object in the schema.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
