        <h2>Viewing Data in a Database Table</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When a database is connected, you can execute an SQL statement in the IDE to view the data contained in a table.</p>
        <p><b>To view data in a table:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Services window, expand the node for a connected database (&nbsp;<img src="images/connection.gif" alt="Database Connection node">&nbsp;).</li>
            <li>Expand the Tables or Views node.</li>
            <li>Right-click the node of the table or view and choose View Data.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>When you choose View Data, an SQL query to select all the data from the table is automatically generated in the upper pane of the SQL Editor.
            The results of the statement are displayed in the lower pane of the SQL Editor.
            You can modify the statement in the SQL Editor and run the modified statement by clicking the Run SQL (&nbsp; <img src="images/runsql.png" alt="Run SQL">&nbsp;) button in the toolbar.</p>
            <p>For more on using the SQL Editor, see <a href="dbmod.html">Executing SQL Statements and Scripts</a>.</p>

        <ul class="note"><li>Each column node has the same View Data item in 
            its pop-up menu. This feature is similar to the feature for tables; 
            however, when you view tables, the SQL statement for viewing data fetches only 
            the one column rather than the entire set of columns that the IDE displays when 
            you choose View Data.</li>
        </ul>
