    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>SQL History provides a list of SQL statements that have been previously executed in the SQL Editor. The SQL can also be inserted in the SQL Editor to be re-executed by selecting a statement in the Table and clicking the Insert button.  </p>
        <p>The order the statements appears in is descending, the more recently executed statement appears at the top of the dialog. To help search for an SQL statement, you can choose the connection for the database against which the statement was executed. </p>
        <p>You can also view matching SQL statements by typing in the Matching SQL textfield. Matching is case insensitive.</p>
        <p>SQL History is invoked from the SQL Editor by clicking  the toolbar icon or by typing the keyboard combination Ctrl-Shift-Alt-h or Command-Shift-Alt-h (Mac OS X). </p>
