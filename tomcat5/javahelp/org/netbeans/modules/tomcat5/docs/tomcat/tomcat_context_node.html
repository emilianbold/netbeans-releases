<h2>Tomcat Web Applications Node</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p> 
<p>The Web Applications node lists 
  the web application contexts that have been deployed to the server. It appears 
  under the server's instance in the Services window. </p>
<p>The IDE adds a web application's context node
the first time that the application is deployed to the server.</p>

<h3>Working With This Node</h3>
<p>You can right-click the Web Application node and choose Refresh to 
    update the list of deployed applications.</p>

<h3>Working With the Web Application's Context Nodes </h3>
<p>You can right-click a web application's context node to access the following
    items in the popup menu.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Start.</b> Restarts a stopped web application.</li>
  <li><b>Stop.</b> Disables the web application so that no one can run it. You 
    can use this action to prevent others from using the web application while 
    fixing or modifying it. If someone tries to run a stopped web application, 
    the server returns HTTP Status 503, which indicates that the application is 
    not currently available.</li>
  <li><b>Open in Browser.</b> Opens the selected web application's URL in the IDE's
    default browser. This item is enabled when the server is running.</li>
   <li><b>Undeploy.</b> Removes the web application's context from the server. The IDE 
    will recreate the context if the web application is subsequently executed from 
    the IDE.</li>
</ul>
