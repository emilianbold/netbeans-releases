<h2>Adding a Tomcat Server</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p> 
<p>When you install the IDE, the installer automatically adds the bundled Tomcat 
  servlet container. You can also configure the IDE to deploy web applications to other 
  installations of supported versions of Tomcat, as shown in the following steps.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
    <td> Before you can add a server, you must have a Tomcat username that has 
      the manager role associated with it. By default, there are no Tomcat user 
      names with the manager role. You must either create a user and associate 
      the manager role with the user or you must add the manager role to an existing 
      username. For more information, see <tt><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/manager-howto.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/manager-howto.html</a>.</tt> 
    </td>
  </tr>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure the server is not running. If the server is running and there 
  is a port number conflict with other installed servers, the IDE will not
  be able to resolve the conflict.</li>
  <li>In the Runtime window, expand the Server Registry node, right-click the 
    Tomcat 5 Servers node, and choose Add New Server from the contextual menu 
    to display the Add New Server dialog box.</li>
  <li>In the Install Directory text box, type or browse to the Tomcat installation 
    directory on your local system. Note that the system verifies that you have 
    specified a valid Tomcat home directory.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you expect to use Tomcat in a multi-user configuration, select 
    the Shared Installation checkbox. and, in the Base Directory text box, type 
    or browse to the base directory. Typically, a base directory is placed under 
    a user's directory. If you associate a base directory with the server, the 
    base directory must have the following subdirectories. In addition, the <tt>conf</tt> 
    directory must have a <tt>server.xml</tt> file.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>conf.</tt></b> Directory for server configuration files</li>
    <li><b><tt>logs.</tt></b> Directory for log and output files</li>
    <li><b><tt>webapps.</tt></b> Directory for automatically loaded web applications</li>
    <li><b><tt>work.</tt></b> Temporary working directory for web applications</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Type a user name and password. The user must be a Tomcat user who has a 
    manager role.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you are using the server for production purposes only, you 
    may want to clear the Enable HTTP Monitor checkbox to reduce its impact on 
    the server's performance. The HTTP Monitor is useful for debugging web applications. 
    You can also enable and disable the monitor from the server's property sheet.</li>
  <li>Click OK. The IDE displays the server's port number in the server node's 
    text. If another server instance is using this port, you must change one of 
    the servers' port numbers. To change a port number, right-click the server's 
    node, choose Start/Stop Server from the contextual menu, and stop the server. 
    Next, right-click the server node and choose Properties from the contextual 
    menu. Change the server port number and restart the server.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you want the IDE to set this server as the default when a
    new web application is created, right-click the server's node and choose Set as Default 
    from the contextual menu. The URL for the default server appears in 
    parentheses next to the Server Registry node.  
  <li>(Optional) If you want the IDE to use this server for executing an existing
    web application, right-click the project node in the Projects window or Files window, select
    Properties and then select Running Project. In the Server dropdown, select
    the server that you want to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to change any setting that you entered in the New Server Dialog box,
right-click the server's node in the Runtime window and choose Properties
from the contextual menu.</p>
