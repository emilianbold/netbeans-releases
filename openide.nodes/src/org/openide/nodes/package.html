The IDE uses

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html"><em>nodes</em></a>

to represent JavaBeans or other property containers, formed into a
hierarchical tree.

<p>These nodes are used extensively for building the UI of the IDE,
especially the Explorer. Using the

<a href="doc-files/api.html"><b>Nodes API</b></a>,

it is possible to create a variety of custom nodes and entire
subhierarchies, and manipulate and search existing nodes. In
conjunction with the

<a href="../loaders/doc-files/api.html"><b>Datasystems API</b></a>,

nodes may also represent persistent data and can present the user
interface to this data. Cookies may also be attached to nodes.
