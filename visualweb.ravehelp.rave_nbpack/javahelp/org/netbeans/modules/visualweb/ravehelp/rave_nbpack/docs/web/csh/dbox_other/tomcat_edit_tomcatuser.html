<h2>HTTP Authentication  dialog box</h2>

<p>It would not be safe to ship web servers with default settings that allowed 
anyone on the Internet to execute them on your server. 
Therefore, the web servers are shipped with the requirement that anyone 
who attempts to use them must authenticate themselves, using a username and password 
with the appropriate role associated with them.</p> 

<p>For example, to authenticate yourself when you want to use
   the Tomcat Manager to deploy your web application, 
   you need a username
   and password for a user with the "manager" role. 
   This username and password are stored in the
   <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file that is in your user
   directory.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      
    <td><img src="../../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      
    <td> You can only use the usernames and passwords that are defined in the 
      IDE's <b>user</b> directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file, and not those 
      that are in the IDE's <b>installation</b> directory. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> During installation, the IDE generates a user called "ide" that is assigned 
  the "manager" role. This user is created in your user directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> 
  file.</p>
  <b>To set the username and password forTomcat server:</b></p>
  <ol>
  <li>In the Services window, right-click the Servers node and choose Add Server. <br>
    The Add Server Instance dialog box opens.  </li>
  <li>Select the applicable server and click Next.</li>
  <li>Browse for the Catalina Home directory. You can also choose to use a private configuration folder. </li>
  <li>Enter the username and password you want to use for the server instance. If the user does not exist, click the checkbox to create the user. </li>
  <li>Click Finish to add the server instance. <br>
    The new username and password is added to the <code>tomcat-users.xml</code> file. </li>
</ol>
<b>To get the username and password   from your user directory:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Help &gt; About 
    from the main menu. </li>
  <li>Make a note of the path to the Userdir folder.</li>
  <li>In your file system, go to your Userdir and then to the <tt>apache-tomcat-6.0.x_base\conf</tt> 
    folder.</li>
  <li>Open the <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file and make a note of the password
  that is defined for the "ide" username.</li>
</ol>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">

      <td>
	 The username and password are <b>not</b> saved when you enter them
	 in this dialog box. The username and password are only saved if
	 you define them in the Tomcat Web Server's Properties dialog box. 
	 To open the Properties dialog box, right-click the Tomcat Web Server's 
	 instance node in the Services window and select
	 Properties.
