       A web application is an application written for the Internet, including those built with
      Java technologies such as JavaServer Pages and servlets, as well as those built with non-Java
      technologies such as CGI and Perl. Web Applications often include frameworks such as
      JavaServer Faces, Visual Web JavaServer Faces, and Struts.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can create a web application in two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By writing and editing Java source code in the Source Editor. Configure the application
        yourself. Add the JavaServer Faces or Struts framework to improve the design of your
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        By using Visual Web JSF drag and drop functionality. Add components to an application by
        dragging them to the Visual Designer. Connect to data sources by dragging a database table
        onto a component.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       A web application roughly corresponds to the J2EE term <i>web application module</i>. This
      is a deployable unit that consists of one or more <a href=
      "../create/about/about_create_webcomps.html">web components</a>, other resources, and <a
      href="../configure/configure_webapp_dd.html">web application deployment descriptors</a>,
      contained in a hierarchy of directories and files in a standard web application format.
