       Files Window for Visual Web JSF Projects
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       The Files window shows the physical storage of a web application in the filesystem. The
      context menu actions available on the tree nodes are file oriented rather than logically
      pertaining to the project. To perform logical operations on a project, it is best to work in
      the Projects window.
    </p>
    <p>
       Choose Window &gt; Files to display the Files view. The following table describes the
      top-level nodes.

             Contains the intermediate output of the build process. The structure and content of
            the build directory reflect the actual web application deployed to the application
            server, including JSP files, compiled Java files, cascading style sheets, images, and
            the root directory for the web. The IDE regenerates this directory when you start a
            build. The IDE deletes this directory when you clean the project. Because the contents
            of this directory are dynamically generated from the project source code, its contents
            should not be placed under source control.
          </p>
          <p>
             The IDE deletes this folder when you choose Build &gt; Clean Main Project or Build
            &gt; Clean and Build Main Project from the main menu.

          directory does not exist. The IDE deletes this directory when you clean a project.
          Because the contents of this directory are dynamically generated from the project source
          code, its contents should not be placed under source control.

              <code>project.xml</code>: the primary metadata repository for project configuration

              under version control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>build-impl.xml</code>: the project-specific Ant script containing the build
              logic for the primary targets defined in the <code>build.xml</code> file. Do not edit
              this file because it is re-generated by the IDE. Put this file under version control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>project.properties</code>: the project-specific Ant properties file containing
              build parameters specific to a particular build scenario. Do not edit this file
              because it is re-generated by the IDE. Put this file under version control.

             The primary Java source root for the project. At this time, only one Java source root
            per project is allowed. All sources are intended to be version controlled.
          </p>
          <p>
             The src node contains Java source files that generate the servlets, beans, and other
            Java classes that are unique to the application. Java package hierarchy is reflected as
            a directory structure underneath this directory. When you create a web application
            project, the IDE creates a default package to hold the backing files for the JavaServer
            Faces web forms. The initial name for this package is derived from the project name.

             Contains the static content of the application (HTML pages, JSP pages, CSS stylesheet
            files, an<font color="#000000">d resources)</font> that will be accessible to
            application clients. This directory will be the document root of the web application,
            and any subdirectory structure found here will be reflected in the request URIs
            required to access those files.
          </p>
          <p>
             The web folder contains the WEB-INF folder which holds special configuration files
            required for the application, including the web application deployment descriptor
            (<code>web.xml</code>), tag library descriptors, and other resource files to be
            included within the web application. Even though this directory appears to be a
            subdirectory of the document root, the Servlet Specification prohibits serving the
            contents of this directory (or any file it contains) directly to a client request.

             Holds the main script for building the project. To execute the <code>build.xml</code>
            file, choose Build &gt; Build Main Project within the IDE or execute
            <code>build.xml</code> from the command line as part of an external build process. If
            you double-click the build.xml node, an XML editor opens to allow you to edit the Ant
            file. If you are familiar with writing Ant build scripts, you can extend the targets in
            this file to perform additional build-time processing if your application requires it.
            Otherwise, there should be no need to edit this file. Whether or not you make changes
            to the <code>build.xml</code> file, it should be placed under source control.
          </p>
          <p>
             If you delete the <code>build.xml</code> file, the IDE regenerates the file the next
            time it builds the application.
