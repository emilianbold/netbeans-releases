Code snippets for many of the most common JSP and HTML tagsare provided -- grouped according to their function:<ul>	<li><b>HTML.</b> Table, Ordered List, Unordered List, Image, Link, MetaData.	<li><b>HTML Forms.</b> Form, Multi-line Input, Checkbox, File Select, Text Input, drop down list,	Radio Button, Button.	<li><b>JSP.</b> Use Bean, Get Bean Property, Set Bean Property, JSTL Choose, 	 JSTL If, JSTL For Each.	<li><b>Database.</b> DB Query, DB Insert, DB Delete, DB Report, DB Update.</ul><p>To use an item in the Palette, drag it from the Palette into the Source Editor and drop it exactly where you want the tags to appear. A dialog box appears. You can fill in values for  the item's standard properties, click OK, and then the IDE generates the tags with your specified values.<p>The IDE provides smart-case <a href="editing/codecompletion/completing-tag.html">code completion</a>for JSP, HTML, and customized tags. When you start writing   a tag, the IDE offers code completion in upper case or lower case, depending   on the case you are using.</p><table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">   <tr valign="top">      <td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>          <td> To enable code completion for a JavaBean class, the JSP file must have       a valid <tt>jsp:useBean</tt> directive, the class must be in a package,       and the class must be available from the <tt>src</tt>       folder or from a library that is included in the compilation classpath.       To enable code completion for tags in tag libraries, the JSP file must have       a valid <tt>taglib</tt> directive for the library and the library must be       included in the compilation classpath.</td>   </tr></table><p>Other examples of additional JSP support are the highlighting of JSP tags,   JSP directives, and EL expressions, <a href="editing/macros/abbreviations.html">editor   abbreviations</a>, <a href="editing/editor_hiding-jsp.html">code   folding</a>, the display of matching JSP tags, JSP delimiters (<tt>&lt;&gt;)</tt>,   and EL delimiters (<tt>{}</tt>), and <a href="editing/editor_navigation.html">code   navigation</a> features such as hyperlinking for JSP identifiers. For example,   you can jump to the tag source file that defines a tag referenced in a JSP file   if you simultaneously hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse over the tag,   as illustrated in <a href="jsp_usetaglib.html">Accessing a Custom Tag from   a JSP Page</a>. <p>To <a href="editing/formatting.html">reformat</a> selected code, right-click in the Source Editor and choose Reformat  Code (Ctrl-Shift-F) from the pop-up menu. If no code is selected, the IDE acts as if the   whole file has been selected. The IDE indents nested tags only if both the start   and end parent tags are in the selected area. Note that this action does not   reformat scriptlets. <dl>	<dt><a name="seealso"></a>See Also</a></dt><dd><a href="jsp_create.html">Creating a JSP File</a></dd><dd><a href="../html/html_create.html">Creating an HTML File</a></dd><dd><a href="about_jsp_encoding.html">About JSP Character Encoding</a></dd></dl><hr><small><a href="../../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small> </body></html>
