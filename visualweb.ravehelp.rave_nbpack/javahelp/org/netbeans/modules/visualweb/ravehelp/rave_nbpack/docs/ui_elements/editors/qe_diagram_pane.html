<h2>About the Diagram Pane </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The diagram pane, the top pane in the 
<a href="about_query_editor.html">Visual SQL Editor</a>, displays the tables and joins in your query. Tables list their columns. Joins appear as lines  between tables. Changes you make to your query in the diagram pane also appear in the <a href="qe_sql_pane.html">SQL pane</a>.</p>
<p>Some things you can do with tables:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View the tables,  columns, and joins in your query.</li>
  <li>Move the tables  in the Visual SQL Editor by dragging them to a new position.</li>
  <li>Add tables  to the query by dragging them from the 
    <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>
    <param name="content" value="../../ui_elements/server_nav/services_win_popup.html">
    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
    <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
    <param name="viewerSize" value="325,175">
    <param name="text" value="Services window"></object> or 
  	by right-clicking in the Visual SQL Editor and choosing Add Table. </li>
  <li>Remove a table  from a query by selecting the table, right-clicking, 
  	and choosing Remove From Query. You can also select a table and press the Delete 
	key or choose Edit &gt; Delete from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Set a table's alias by selecting the table and entering the new alias in the <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/files/files_properties.html">Properties window</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some things you can do with joins: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Set join properties, such as whether it's an INNER join or an OUTER join, by selecting the join and changing the properties in the Properties window. </li>
  <li>Create joins between tables. The Visual SQL Editor automatically creates joins between tables based on 
  	  foreign key metadata, but you can create additional joins by dragging a column from one table onto 
	  a column in a second table. For example, if you drag TABLE1.COLUMN1 to TABLE 2.COLUMN4, the 
	  IDE adds the following code to the WHERE clause:
    <p><code>WHERE TABLE1.COLUMN1 = TABLE 2.COLUMN4</code></p></li>
    <li>Delete joins by selecting the 
    join line and pressing the Delete key. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some things you can do with columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View the types of columns included in the query.  A key icon indicates that the column is a 
  primary key; a primary key is a unique identifier for each value in a row, such as a Social 
  Security number. A key with an arrow indicates that the column is a foreign key; a foreign key 
  links an item in a row back to a primary key in another table.</li>
   <!--From Paul: When time permits, add inline graphics for the key icon and the key with an arrow. Also
    instead of defining "primary key" and "foreign key" in line, add definition topics for them, 
	because they could also be referenced from other topics.  -->
  <li>Add or remove columns from the query. To add a column, make sure that its checkbox 
  	is selected. To remove a column, clear the checkbox.</li>
  <li>Add a Group By clause by right-clicking the pane and choosing Group By.  Group By groups the 
  results by row.</li>
  <!-- From Paul: Add an example of a GROUP BY. Problem: we don't have any data values we sum in TravelCenter.
  It's all text values to display. At some point, research this. Here's the syntax:
  <li>
    <pre>
SELECT ?, SUM (?) FROM ?
SELECT Company, SUM(Amount) FROM Sales</pre> --></ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li>If the SQL query contains code that is not supported by the diagram pane, 
   the diagram pane becomes blank, but you might still be able to execute the 
   query. </li>
</ul>
