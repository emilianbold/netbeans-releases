<h4>web server </h4>
<p>Software that provides services to access the Internet, an intranet, or an 
  extranet. A web server hosts web sites, provides support for HTTP and other 
  protocols, and executes server-side programs (such as CGI scripts or servlets) 
  In the J2EE architecture, a web server provides services to a web container. 
  For example, a web container typically relies on a web server to provide HTTP 
  message handling. The J2EE architecture assumes that a web container is hosted 
  by a web server from the same vendor, so it does not specify the contract between 
  these two entities. A web server can host one or more web containers.</p>
