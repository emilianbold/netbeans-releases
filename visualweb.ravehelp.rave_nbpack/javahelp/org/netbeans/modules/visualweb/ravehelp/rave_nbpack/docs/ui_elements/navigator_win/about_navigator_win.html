To open the Navigator window, in the main toolbar, choose   Window &gt; Navigating &gt; Navigator. </p><p>The contents of this window change depending on what you are currently editing. When a visual JavaServer Faces page is open in Design mode in the Visual Designer, you see a node for the current page in the application   plus all the non-page managed beans, such as any session beans, application beans,   or request beans.  The following list describes each node:</p><ul>  <li><b><i>page-name</i> node.</b> The <i>page-name</i> node shows all the   	objects on the current page, including nonvisual objects like database table     RowSets, Validators, and Converters. The runtime scope of each page is Request, meaning that information is     not saved between page requests.</li>  <li><b>The beans nodes</b>. Bean properties are reflected here. You can edit the code for a bean in the   Java Editor by right-clicking the bean and choosing Edit Java Source. You typically add bean properties to a managed bean as described in <a href="../../web/about/webapps_quickref.html">Web Application  Tasks: Quick Reference</a>.</li>  <ul>  	<li><b>RequestBean node.</b> This bean has a runtime scope of Request. A request is a single transmission of an HTTP request from the client to the server plus the corresponding response, which can be another page. In most cases, the request begins with the clicking of a button or a link and ends with the response of an HTML page to be displayed. Use this bean to store information that you  need to preserve for only a single user request, such as information to pass to the next page. Any value that you store in the Request Bean disappears as soon as the request ends.</li>  	<li><b>SessionBean node.</b> By default, there is one session    	 	bean for each project. This bean has a runtime scope of Session. Use this 		bean to  store information that you want to preserve   		across page requests for a single user session, such as a user's logon information.</li>  	<li><b>ApplicationBean node.</b> By default, there is one     	application bean for each project. This bean has a runtime     	scope of Application and is where you store information that   		you want to preserve across all user sessions, such as the contents of         a drop down list showing a list of all countries.</li>  </ul></ul><h3>Using the Navigator Window</h3><p>You can use this window as follows: </p><ul>  <li> You can drop components directly from the Palette or <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>    <param name="content" value="../../ui_elements/server_nav/services_win_popup.html">    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">    <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">    <param name="viewerSize" value="325,175">    <param name="text" value="Services window"></object>    on   components in the Navigator window to determine the parent object.  You can drop between components (when there are multiple   siblings) to control&nbsp; where in the list a child appears,   such as for the children of a grid panel. </li>  <li>You can reorder, and reparent, components by dragging them around&nbsp; within   the outline. For example you can drag a button from the form into a grid panel   component for example, or back out. </li>  <li>You can work with elements of a page that       are  hard to select in the Visual Designer because they       are not visual or they are embedded in other components or simply referenced     by those components. For example, the checkbox group is composed of several other 	components.  If you select the <code>checkboxGroup</code> component in the  	Outline window you can bind it to a bean property or database that will provide   	the options displayed in the component. For more information,   	see <a href="../palette/jsfstd/checkbox_list.html">Checkbox   	Group Component</a>. </li>  <!--  <li>Select visual and nonvisual components and copy or move     them to other pages.</li>  <li>Select nonvisual components and move them to the session     bean or application bean. Doing so changes the scope of a     component from request scope to session or application scope.</li>-->  <li>Select a component's node and edit  it. Right-click the node and choose Edit  Java Source or Edit JSP Source. When a component node is highlighted in the Navigator window, you can edit its properties in the <a href="../propsheets/propsheet_win.html">Properties window</a>.</li>  <li>Right-click a component's node and work with the same contextual   menu choices as you would in the Visual Designer.</li>  <li>You can double-click any of the managed beans, such as SessionBean1, and edit the bean's source code. You typically do this when you want to add a property to the bean. </li></ul><dl>  <dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt>  <dd><a href="../../web/about/about_webapps.html">About Web Applications </a></dd>  <dd><a href="../editors/about_visual_editor.html">About the Visual Designer</a></dd><dd><a href="application_bean_node.html">Application Bean Node</a></dd><dd><a href="request_bean_node.html">Request Bean Node</a></dd><dd><a href="session_bean_node.html">Session Bean Node</a></dd></dl><dl><dt><a name="tutorials">Tutorials</a></dt><dd><object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">		<param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/55/vwp-listbox_components.html">		<param name="text" value="Using Listbox Components"></object></dd></dl><hr><!-- Start Customer Feedback Link --><!-- <p><b>Comments or questions?</b><br>Use the link below to connect to the Visual Web Development contact page. </p>  <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkButton">    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/about/contact_form.html?to=4&subject=Feedback:%20Web%20Application%20Help:%20About the Navigator Window">    <param name="text" value="<html><u>Click here to send feedback</u></html>"></object><br> --> <!-- End Customer Feedback Link -->  <small><a href="../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small> <table cellpadding="50" border="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
