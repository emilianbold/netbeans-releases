<h2>JSF 1.2 File Upload Component Properties Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also | Tutorials  </a></small><small><a href="#tutorials"></a></small></p>

<p>You see the Properties window for a File Upload component <img src="../../../../images/bh_file_upload_icon.gif" alt="file upload icon">&nbsp;when you select the component on a page that you are editing in the Visual Designer.</p>
<p>Most of the File Upload component's properties are both JSP attributes and properties of the <code>Upload</code> Java component in the page bean.</p>
<p>This JavaServer Faces 1.2 component has the following properties.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>id.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
		The name of the File Upload component in the page bean and the JSP file. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>columns.</b><code> Type: int </code><br>
	  The number of character character columns used to render the field. The default is 
40. On some browsers, this setting is overridden if you set the width in the <code>style</code> property. For example, Internet Explorer observes the width setting, but Mozilla does not. Also, the component is usually larger in the Visual Designer than it is in the web browser and might not appear to line up correctly, so be sure to test the component's appearance in the web browser and adjust the component as needed in the Visual Designer. </li>
	<li><b>label.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
  If text is specified for this property, a label showing the text is displayed with the component.
<ul class="note">
			    <li>The <code>label</code> property is not as flexible as the <a href="../label.html">Label component</a>. You can use the Label component if you want more control over the label's appearance, such as positioning of the label relative to the component.</li>
      </ul>
</li>
	<li><b>labelLevel.</b><code> Type: int </code><br>
  A number that affects the appearance of the label. 1 (Strong) is larger and bold. 2 (Medium), the default, is smaller and bold. 3 (Weak) is smaller and normal (not bold). This property takes effect only if the label property is set. </li>

<li><b>style.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
		Cascading Style Sheet rules (CSS level 2) to be applied to the component.  For example:
		<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: absolute; left: 288px; top: 312px</code></p>
<p>You can enter values directly or click the ellipsis (...) button to use the <a href="../../../propeditors/style_prop_ed_main.html">Style Editor</a>.
    <ul class="note">
          <li>This property overrides any settings in the theme or the project CSS file for this component. If a style specified in this property does not appear to take effect, it is because an area of the component is obscured by a child component that has different style settings.</li>
    </ul>

	  <p>For a list of CSS2 style attributes, see the web page at<br>
        <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
	      <param name="content" value="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/propidx.html">
	      <param name="text" value="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/propidx.html"></object>
    </p>
  </li>
	<li><b>styleClass.<a name="themecss"></a></b><code> Type: String</code><br>A space-separated list of CSS2 style classes to be applied when the component is rendered. The style classes must be defined in the project's style sheet or in the theme's CSS file. If you click the ellipsis button (...), you see a list of all styles you can add to this property. For information on adding CSS classes and rules to the project's cascading style sheet, see <a href="../../../editors/about_css_editor.html">CSS Editor</a>.<ul class="note"><li>See the note above under the <code>style</code> property description for an explanation of why a class added to this property might appear to have no effect on the component. </li>
      <li> If you add a CSS style class from the current <a href="../../../../components/aboutthemes.html">theme</a> to your project CSS file and you redefine the style class, the change affects all components that use this style class. However, you can add your own style classes to the project CSS file that redefine the default style classes, and then when you add them to this property, the changes affect only this instance of this component.</li>
      </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>required.</b><code> Type: boolean </code><br>
	  If selected, the user must enter a value for the file upload before the page can be submitted. If you add a <a href="../message.html">Message component</a> to the page and link its <code>for</code> property to this component, an error message will be displayed if the user  tries to submit the page without entering a value.</li>
	<li><b>uploadedFile.</b><code> Type: UploadedFile </code><br>
		Indicates the file chosen by the user. The value of this property is an expression that resolves to 
an object of type <code>com.sun.webui.jsf.model.UploadedFile</code>. This property is read-only and cannot be set in the Properties window. You can use the corresponding Java <code>Upload</code> component's <code>getUploadedFile()</code> method  to access the  uploaded file's contents.</li>
    <li><b>validatorExpression.</b><code> Type: MethodExpression</code><br>
Indicates the JavaServer Faces validator expression that is used when the value is submitted. A validator  ensures
that the correct value is entered by a user. If the conditions defined by the validator are not met, the validator sends a message that you can display in a <a href="../message.html">Message component</a>. 
<p>Choose a validator from the drop down list. If you choose <code>(null)</code>, no validator is called. If you choose a validator, you might also want to select the <code>required</code> property to ensure that the user enters a value.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>You can define your own validate method, for example, by right-clicking the component and choosing Edit Event Handler &gt; validate. If you define your own method, any value you might have set in this property is overridden. </li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>disabled.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br>
    If selected, indicates that the component should never receive focus or be included in a submit. Use this property when the component does not apply to the page. See the note under the <code>readOnly</code> property concerning the effects of using the <code>disabled</code> property versus the effects of using the <code>readOnly</code> property.</li>
  <li><b>readOnly.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br>
    If selected, makes it impossible for the user to enter values, but still makes it possible for the component's value to be submitted.
Use this property when the component does apply but must not be changed.       
      <ul class="note">
        <li>A readonly field is included when the page is submitted, in contrast to a disabled field, which is not included when the page is submitted.  If you use the <code>disabled</code> property, JavaServer Faces does not detect that any value at all was submitted.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>toolTip.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
  Rendered as the HTML <code>title</code> attribute of the component, which is readable by a screen reader and can be displayed as a tool tip.
  <ul class="note">
  <li>If the component is disabled, the tooltip will not display in most browsers. 
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>visible.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br>
  Indicates whether or not the  component can be seen by the user on the rendered HTML page. This property is selected by default. If you deselect this property, the component's HTML code is rendered on the page, but the component is not visible  in the browser because it is hidden by a style setting. Because the HTML code is rendered, the component can still be processed on form submissions, and users who view source in the browser can see the HTML code. In addition, your web application can use client-side JavaScript to show or hide the component.  
    <ul class="note">
      <li>If you need to completely hide the component, for example, because it contains sensitive information that certain users should not see, deselect the <code>rendered</code> property.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>tabIndex.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    Optionally specifies the position of the component in the tab order of the document, determining when the component will get focus if the user tabs through the document. The value must be an integer between 0 and 32767.</li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>onBlur.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component loses focus. </li>
  <li><b>onChange.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component loses focus and its value was modified after it gained focus. </li>
  <li><b>onClick.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user clicks the component.</li>
  <li><b>onDblClick.</b> <code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user double-clicks the component.</li>
  <li><b>onFocus.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component gains focus. </li>
  <li><b>onKeyDown.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component has focus and a key is pressed. </li>
  <li><b>onKeyPress.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component has focus and a key is pressed and released.</li>
  <li><b>onKeyUp.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the component has focus and a key is released.</li>
  <li><b>onMouseDown.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the mouse cursor is over the component and the user presses down on the mouse button.</li>
  <li><b>onMouseMove.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user moves the mouse cursor within the component.</li>
  <li><b>onMouseOut.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user moves the mouse cursor away from the component after it has been over the component.</li>
  <li><b>onMouseOver.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user moves the mouse cursor onto the component.</li>
  <li><b>onMouseUp.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the mouse cursor is over the component and the user releases the mouse button.</li>
  <li><b>onSelect.</b><code> Type: String</code><br>
    JavaScript to be executed when the user selects text in the component.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>immediate.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br>
	  If this property is selected, when the user activates the file upload, the code in the page bean is executed before the validation, updating of model values, and so on. Essentially, code execution happens right away on the server, which then returns the page.
A simpler way of getting this functionality is to associate the component with a <a href="../../../../components/aboutvirtualforms.html">virtual form</a>, and then right-click the component and choose Auto-Submit on Change.    
<p>The most common example of an immediate action is a Cancel button. You make it immediate so that the normal validation and update steps can be skipped, but the action handler can still do whatever is necessary. Typically, the action handler will navigate back to some previous page. In some designs the action handler might also enqueue an informational message like &quot;Transaction cancelled&quot;. It is possible to do more: for example, an application might record the fact that the user cancelled the current operation.</p></li>
  <li><b>preservePath.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br> 
	  The default value, not selected (false), means that full path information is not preserved for the component, and the default browser behavior will prevail. 
      <p> If <code>preservePath</code> is selected (true), the component preserves the literal value of the file input element  set by the user on the client. The reason this property is provided is that browsers handle the value of an HTML input element of type <code>file</code> differently. Some browsers submit the literal value of the input element in the multipart/form-data file portion of the request, and others submit only the file name portion and not the directory portion. </p>
<ul class="warning">
    <li>It is not clear if it is a security risk to transmit the full file path in clear text to the server.</li>
</ul>
    <p>If this property is selected, the literal value (typically the full path name either entered explicitly by the user or set by choosing from a file selection dialogue) is stored and submitted in a hidden field. The <code>UploadRenderer</code>  preserves the full file path in the corresponding <code>UploadFilterFileItem</code> instance, which is encapsulated by the <code>UploadedFile</code> instance. You can retrieve the saved path by using the <code>UploadedFile</code> object's <code>getClientFilePath</code> method. </p>
<p>
For example, there is a File Upload component named fileUpload1, and its preservePath property is checked. There is also a button and a message group component on the page.  Adding the following code to the button component's action method displays the client file path in the message group component: </p>
<pre>   UploadedFile uploadedFile1 = fileUpload1.getUploadedFile();
   info(&quot;Uploaded file's client file path: '&quot; + 
         uploadedFile1.getClientFilePath() + &quot;'&quot;);</pre>
</li>
	<li><b>rendered.</b><code> Type: boolean</code><br>
	    If selected, the file upload is to be rendered and processed on any subsequent page submission. If not selected, the file upload does not appear on the page at all, not even as a hidden component.
        <p>You can bind this property to a JavaBeans property that determines when the file upload does get rendered. For example, an airline reservation form might show a file upload for frequent flyers and not show it for the general public. To bind this property, click the ellipsis button (...) to the right of the property and choose Use Binding in the dialog box.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
		<h3>Events</h3>
		<p>Set the event properties by right-clicking the component in the Visual Designer and choosing Edit Event Handler &gt; <i>eventname</i>.</p>
		<ul>
          <li><b>validate.</b> Indicates the name of the method that is called to validate the value of the component, if any. If you want to code a validate method rather than choosing a JavaServer Faces validator for the <code>validatorExpression</code> property, right-click the component and choose Edit Event Handler &gt; validate. The default name for the method is <code><i>component-id</i>_validate</code>, where <i>component-id</i> is the value of the component's <code>id</code> property. When you define this method in this way, the <code>validator</code> and <code>validate</code> properties are automatically set for you. If you define a validator, you might also want to select the <code>required</code> property to ensure that the user enters a value.
            
              <ul class="note">
                <li>Setting this property also sets the value of the <code>validatorExpression</code> property. If you define your own validate method, do not separately change the value of the <code>validatorExpression</code> property, or you will lose the connection to your validate method.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>valueChange.</b> Indicates the name of the component value change listener method that is called when the value of the component changes. You typically define this method in the page bean by right-clicking the component in the Visual Designer and choosing Edit Event Handler &gt; processValueChange. The default name for the method is <code><i>component-id</i>_processValueChange</code>, where <i>component-id</i> is the value of the component's <code>id</code> property.
              <ul class="note">
                <li>Use this method rather than the action method if you have set the Auto-Submit on Change item in the component's pop-up menu.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
	  </ul>
