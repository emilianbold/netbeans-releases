<h2>Add Forward/Include Action Dialog Box</h2>

A Struts action responds to a request. Writing an action means subclassing one 
of the <tt>Action</tt> classes and then overriding the class's <tt>execute</tt> method. 
Use the <a href="file_ActionPanel.html">New Struts Action wizard</a> for this purpose.

<p>In some exceptional scenarios, you do not need an action to execute, but you <i>do</i> want to
 redirect to a new JSP page. In these exceptional scenarios, you have two options:

 <ul>
	 <li><b>Forward Action.</b> Specifies a bridge from the JSP page to another JSP page or an action.
	   <li><b>Include Action.</b> Specifies the same as a forwardaction, except that the JSP page or action
	    is going to be included by another JSP page or action.    
 </ul>

<ul class="note">
	<li>When you use the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box,
	the <tt>forward</tt> or <tt>include</tt> is an attribute, rather than an element. The attribute
	   makes the mapping functionally equivalent to the element, however, the tag is shorter.
</ul>


<p>You use the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box to register an action forward or an
 action include in the <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file.
You open the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box by right-clicking in a <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file and
choosing Struts &gt; Add Forward/Include Action.

<p>In the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box, you set the following properties:

<ul>
<li><b>Action Path.</b> Specifies the application context-relative path to the action.</li>
<li>Action Type.
 <ul>
	 <li><b>Forward Action.</b> Specifies a bridge from the JSP page to another JSP page or an action.
	   <li><b>Include Action.</b> Specifies the same as a forwardaction, except that the JSP page or action
	    is going to be included by another JSP page or action.    
 </ul>
<li>Call.
<ul>
	<li><b>Resource File.</b> Specifies the path to the JSP page that handles the action.</li>
	<li><b>Action.</b> Specifies the action that handles the forwardaction or includeaction.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<ul class="note">
	<li>If you want to change a registered forwardaction or includeaction, you can do
	so by manually editing the XML tags in the <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file.
</ul>
