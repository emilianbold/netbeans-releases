<h4>deployment server</h4>
<p>A server to which you deploy your applications. During development, you must
   deploy an application to a server if you want to test it. The IDE installs
  one deployment server for you, the Sun Java<small>TM</small> System Application Server 9.1, which contains a web server.</p>
<p>A web server provides services to access the Internet, an intranet, or an extranet. 
  It hosts web sites, provides support for HTTP and other protocols, and executes 
  server-side programs such as CGI scripts or servlets. </p>
<p>In the J2EE<sup><small>TM</small></sup> architecture, a web server provides 
  services to a web container. For example, a web container typically relies on 
  a web server to provide HTTP message handling. A web server can host one or 
  more web containers.</p>
