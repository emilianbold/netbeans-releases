<h2>Project Properties: Sources Category </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Sources panel of the Project Properties dialog box enables you to view the project folder location, to manage source  folders, and to set the source level of the packages that the IDE will use. You can open the Project Properties dialog box from the <a href="../../ui_elements/project_nav/projectlogical.html">Projects window</a> by right-clicking a project and choosing Properties.
  <!--explain source level?-->
Then select Sources in the Categories list on the left side. </p>
<p>You can change the location of your web pages by clicking the Browse button next to the Web Pages Folder field.</p>
<p>Use the buttons on the right side of the Sources panel to add, remove, and change the order of packages. Choosing Add enables you to add an additional source root. You can have multiple source roots in a standard project, with the following exceptions: 

<ul class=tip>
  <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project. </li>
  <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the 
  	same project. </li>
  <li>All  the source roots must be packaged into the same JAR file and share the 
  	same classpath. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a source root that you want to use with  several projects, you 
  	must create a separate project for the source root and set up compilation 
	dependencies between the projects. </p>
<!--
<P>You can use the Source Level drop-down list at the bottom of the Sources page to 
set the Java platform version that the generated Java code should be compatible with. 
This setting corresponds to the javac -source option. 
<UL class=note>
  <li>Specifying the Source Level does not change the Java platform whose 
  	libraries and executables are used to compile and run your project. To 
	set the Java platform that is used for compiling and running your project, 
	click Libraries and set the Java Platform setting. You cannot set the Source 
	Level of a project to a higher release than the project's Java platform.</li>
</UL>-->
