     claims:
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
          as part of a Larger Work; and

          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
          Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of

          Version (or portions of such combination).

          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
          the Covered Code.

          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is

          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

          IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.
          Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License, Netscape
          has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's Branded Code.
          To the extent that Netscape is limited contractually from making
          such third party code available under this License, Netscape may
          choose to reintegrate such code into Covered Code without being
          required to distribute such code in Source Code form, even if
          such code would otherwise be considered "Modifications" under
          this License.

          V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.
               V.1. In General.
               The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to
               the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and V.3.

               V.2. Other Products.
               Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than the
               Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape
               during the two (2) years following the release date of the
               Original Code, without such additional products becoming
               subject to the terms of this License, and may license such
               additional products on different terms from those contained
               in this License.

               V.3. Alternative Licensing.
               Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's Branded
               Code, including Modifications incorporated therein, without
               such Netscape Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of
               this License, and may license such Netscape Branded Code on
               different terms from those contained in this License.

          VI. Litigation.
          Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the
          provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c) of
          the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this License.

any Component EULA, the terms of this EULA shall control. The Software may
also contain thirdparty software programs. Any such software is provided
for your use as a convenience and your use is subject to the terms and
conditions of any license agreement contained in that software.
2. ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS -- REDISTRIBUTABLE CODE. In addition to the
rights granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software, as described
in this Section 2, are provided to you with additional license rights.
These additional license rights are conditioned upon your compliance with
the distribution requirements and license limitations described in Section
3.
2.1 Sample Code. Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive,
royalty-free license to: (a) use and modify the source code version of those
portions of the Software identified as "Samples" in REDIST.TXT or elsewhere
in the Software ("Sample Code") for the sole purposes of designing,
developing, and testing your software product(s), and (b) reproduce and

all other applicable redistribution requirements for MSM files, see Section
3.1 below.
2.4 Redistributable Code-Visual C++: Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC), Active Template Libraries (ATL), and C runtimes (CRTs). If this EULA
accompanies Visual C++, then in addition to the rights granted in Section 1,
Microsoft grants you a license to use and modify the source code version of
those portions of the Software that are identified as MFC, ATL, or CRTs
(collectively, the "VC Redistributables"), for the sole purposes of
designing, developing, and testing your software product(s). Provided you
comply with Section 3.1 and you rename any files created by you that are
included in the Licensee Software (defined below), Microsoft grants you a
limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and distribute the
object code version of the VC Redistributables, including any modifications
you make. For purposes of this section, "modifications" shall mean
enhancements to the functionality of the VC Redistributables. For all other
applicable redistribution requirements for VC Redistributables, see Section
3.1 below.
3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER LICENSE RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS. If
you choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by
you is subject to your compliance with Section 3.1; some of the
Redistributable Code has additional limited use rights described in Section
3.2.
3.1 General Distribution Requirements.
(a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or
Redistributable Code (collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in
Section 2, you agree: (i) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample
Code), to distribute the Redistributables only in object code form and in
conjunction with and as a part of a software application product developed
by you that adds significant and primary functionality to the
Redistributables ("Licensee Software"); (ii) that the Redistributables only
operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows platforms; (iii) that if the
Licensee Software is distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally
from Licensee's organization, to distribute the Licensee Software containing
the Redistributables pursuant to an end user license agreement (which may be
"break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed), with terms no less protective
than those contained in this EULA; (iv) not to use Microsoft's name, logo,
or trademarks to market the Licensee Software; (v) to display your own valid
copyright notice which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft's copyright
in the Software; (vi) not to remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or
patent notices that appear on the Software as delivered to you; (vii) to
indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any claims
or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or
distribution of the Licensee Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with the
terms of this EULA; and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not
expressly granted.
You also agree not to permit further distribution of the
Redistributables by your end users except you may permit further
redistribution of the Redistributables by your distributors to your end-user
customers if your distributors only distribute the Redistributables in
conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee Software, you comply with all
other terms of this EULA, and your distributors comply with all restrictions
of this EULA that are applicable to you.
(b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your
compliance with the applicable distribution requirements described for the
Redistributables, the following also applies. Your license rights to the
Redistributables are conditioned upon your not (i) creating derivative works
of the Redistributables in any manner that would cause the Redistributables
in whole or in part to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded
License; or (ii) distributing the Redistributables (or derivative works
thereof) in any manner that would cause the Redistributables to become
subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License. An "Excluded License"
is any license that requires as a condition of use, modification and/or
distribution of software subject to the Excluded License, that such software
or other software combined and/or distributed with such software be (x)
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (y) licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works; or (z) redistributable at no charge.
3.2 Additional Distribution Requirements for Certain Redistributable
Code. If you choose to redistribute the files discussed in this Section,
then in addition to the terms of Section 3.1, you must ALSO comply with the
following.
(a) Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine ("MSDE"). If you
redistribute MSDE you agree to comply with the following additional
requirements: (a) Licensee Software shall not substantially duplicate the
capabilities of Microsoft Access or, in the reasonable opinion of Microsoft,
compete with same; and (b) unless Licensee Software requires your customers
to license Microsoft Access in order to operate, you shall not reproduce or
use MSDE for commercial distribution in conjunction with a general purpose
word processing, spreadsheet or database management software product, or an
integrated work or product suite whose components include a general purpose
word processing, spreadsheet, or database management software product except
for the exclusive use of importing data to the various formats supported by
Microsoft Access. A product that includes limited word processing, spreadsh
eet or database components along with other components which provide
significant and primary value, such as an accounting product with limited
spreadsheet capability, is not considered to be a "general purpose" product.
(b) Microsoft Data Access Components. If you redistribute the
Microsoft Data Access Component file identified as MDAC_TYP.EXE, you also
agree to redistribute such file in object code only in conjunction with and
as a part of a Licensee Software developed by you with a Microsoft
development tool product that adds significant and primary functionality to
MDAC_TYP.EXE.
3.3 Separation of Components. The Software is licensed as a single
product. Its component parts may not be separated for use by more than one
user.
3.4 Benchmark Testing. The Software may contain the Microsoft .NET
Framework. You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test of the
.NET Framework component of the Software to any third party without
Microsoft's prior written approval.
4. PRERELEASE CODE. Portions of the Software may be identified as prerelease
code ("Prerelease Code"). Such Prerelease Code is not at the level of
performance and compatibility of the final, generally available product
offering. The Prerelease Code may not operate correctly and may be
substantially modified prior to first commercial shipment. Microsoft is not
obligated to make this or any later version of the Prerelease Code
commercially available. The grant of license to use Prerelease Code expires
upon availability of a commercial release of the Prerelease Code from
Microsoft. NOTE: In the event that Prerelease Code contains a separate
end-user license agreement, the terms and conditions of such end-user
license agreement shall govern your use of the corresponding Prerelease
Code.
5. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP. Microsoft reserves all rights not
expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by
copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Microsoft or
its suppliers own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property
rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except and
only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable
law notwithstanding this limitation.
7. NO RENTAL/COMMERCIAL HOSTING. You may not rent, lease, lend or provide
commercial hosting services with the Software.
8. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA. You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may
collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product
support services provided to you, if any, related to the Software.
Microsoft may use this information solely to improve our products or to

updates to third party sites. Microsoft is not responsible for webcasting
or any other form of transmission received from any third party sites.
Microsoft is providing these links to third party sites to you only as a
convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply an endorsement by
Microsoft of the third party site.
10. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES. This EULA applies to updates,
supplements, add-on components, or Internet-based services components, of
the Software that Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you
after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we
provide other terms along with the update, supplement, add-on component, or
Internet-based services component. Microsoft reserves the right to
discontinue any Internet-based services provided to you or made available to
you through the use of the Software.
11. UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES
11.1 Upgrades. To use a version of the Software identified as an upgrade,
you must first be licensed for the software identified by Microsoft as
eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer use the
software that formed the basis for your upgrade eligibility.
11.2 Downgrades. Instead of installing and using the Software, you may
install and use copies of an earlier version of the Software, provided that
you completely remove such earlier version and install the current version
of the Software within a reasonable time. Your use of such earlier version
shall be governed by this EULA, and your rights to use such earlier version
shall terminate when you install the Software.

additional information see <http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/>.
15. SOFTWARE TRANSFER. The initial user of the Software may make a one-time
permanent transfer of this EULA and Software to another end user, provided
the initial user retains no copies of the Software. This transfer must
include all of the Software (including all component parts, the media and
printed materials, any upgrades this EULA, and, if applicable, the
Certificate of Authenticity). The transfer may not be an indirect transfer,
such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the
Software must agree to all the EULA terms.
16. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may
terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of
this EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Software and

17. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA.
Except for the Redistributables, which are provided AS IS, without warranty
of any kind, Microsoft warrants that the Software will perform substantially
in accordance with the accompanying materials for a period of ninety (90)
days from the date of receipt.
If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction
and federal or state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also
have an implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED
DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS
DISCOVERED AFTER THE NINETYDAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF
ANY KIND. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an
implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply
to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Software, including without limitation,
any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration
of the ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or
condition, express, implied or statutory.
LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive
remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below.
Except for any refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY
DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Software
does not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent
allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential
purpose. The terms of Section 19 ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential
and Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated into this Limited
Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion
may not apply to you. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal
rights. You may have other rights which vary from state/jurisdiction to
state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Microsoft's and its suppliers'
entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited
Warranty or for any other breach of this EULA or for any other liability
relating to the Software shall be, at Microsoft's option from time to time
exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the amount paid (if any)
for the Software, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software, that does
not meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy
of your receipt. You will receive the remedy elected by Microsoft without
charge, except that you are responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g.
cost of shipping the Software to Microsoft). This Limited Warranty is void
if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse,
misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement Software will be
warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30)
days, whichever is longer, and Microsoft will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide your remedy within a commercially reasonable time of your
compliance with Microsoft's warranty remedy procedures. Outside the United
States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services
offered by Microsoft are available without proof of purchase from an
authorized international source. To exercise your remedy, contact:
Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft
Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your
country.

only express warranty made to you and is provided in lieu of any other
express warranties or similar obligations (if any) created by any
advertising, documentation, packaging, or other communications. EXCEPT FOR
THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES (IF

MISREPRESENTATION, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF
WARRANTY OF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER, AND EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER

OR ANYTHING ELSE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MICROSOFT AND ANY OF ITS
SUPPLIERS UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

The following MICROSOFT GUARANTEE applies to you if you acquired this
Software in any other country:

Statutory rights not affected - The following guarantee is not restricted to
any territory and does not affect any statutory rights that you may have
from your reseller or from Microsoft if you acquired the Software directly
from Microsoft. If you acquired the Software or any support services in
Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia, please see the "Consumer rights" section
below.

The guarantee - The Software is designed and offered as a general-purpose
software, not for any user's particular purpose. You accept that no
Software is error free and you are strongly advised to back-up your files
regularly. Provided that you have a valid license, Microsoft guarantees
that a) for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of your license to
use the Software or the shortest period permitted by applicable law it will
perform substantially in accordance with the written materials that
accompany the Software; and b) any support services provided by Microsoft
shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided
to you by Microsoft and Microsoft support engineers will use reasonable
efforts, care and skill to solve any problem issues. In the event that the
Software fails to comply with this guarantee, Microsoft will either (a)
repair or replace the Software or (b) return the price you paid. This
guarantee is void if failure of the Software results from accident, abuse or
misapplication. Any replacement Software will be guaranteed for the
remainder of the original guarantee period or 30 days, whichever period is
longer. You agree that the above guarantee is your sole guarantee in
relation to the Software and any support services.

Exclusion of All Other Terms - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law and subject to the guarantee above, Microsoft disclaims all warranties,
conditions and other terms, either express or implied (whether by statute,
common law, collaterally or otherwise) including but not limited to implied
warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for particular purpose with
respect to the Software and the written materials that accompany the
Software. Any implied warranties that cannot be excluded are limited to 90
days or to the shortest period permitted by applicable law, whichever is
greater.

Limitation of Liability - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law
and except as provided in the Microsoft Guarantee, Microsoft and its
suppliers shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever (including without
limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption,
loss of business information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use
or inability to use the Software, even if Microsoft has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. In any case Microsoft's entire liability under
any provision of this Agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid
by you for the Software. These limitations do not apply to any liabilities
that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable laws.

Consumer rights - Consumers in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia may have
the benefit of certain rights and remedies by reason of the Trade Practices
Act and similar state and territory laws in Australia, the Consumer
Guarantees Act in New Zealand and the Consumer Protection Act in Malaysia in
respect of which liability cannot lawfully be modified or excluded. If you
acquired the Software in New Zealand for the purposes of a business, you
confirm that the Consumer Guarantees Act does not apply. If you acquired
the Software in Australia and if Microsoft breaches a condition or warranty
implied under any law which cannot lawfully be modified or excluded by this
agreement then, to the extent permitted by law, Microsoft's liability is
limited, at Microsoft's option, to: (i) in the case of the Software: a)
repairing or replacing the Software; or b) the cost of such repair or
replacement; and (ii) in the case of support services: a) re-supply of the
services; or b) the cost of having the services supplied again.
