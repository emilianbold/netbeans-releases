/**
 * Factory for instances of Cards that provide cards for a given Java Card Platform
 * kind.  Instances of CardsFactory are registered in the default lookup (via
 * a module layer XML file, typically), in a folder corresponding to the platform
 * kind they work with.  The platform kind in is specified in a Java Card SDK's
 * <code>platform.properties</code> file.  For instance, if you wanted to
 * register a CardsFactory that will create Card instances for all platforms
 * which say their kind is <code>MyCard</code>, you would implement CardsFactory
 * and register an instance
 * of it in <code>org-netbeans-modules-javacard-spi/kinds/MyCard</code>.
 * <p/>
 * Using this interface, plus the support for SDKs which wrapper functionality
 * from the Java Card RI, you can have an SDK which reuses much of the functionality
 * of the RI (i.e. you do not need to implement JavacardPlatform yourself), but,
 * simply by specifying a different platform kind, provides its own support for
 * detecting attached cards and allowing the user to deploy to them.
