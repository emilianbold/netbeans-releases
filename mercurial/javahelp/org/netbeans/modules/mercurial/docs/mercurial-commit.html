        <h2>Mercurial: Committing Changes to the Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited, 
            you can then place changes into the repository using the Mercurial 
            Commit action. If you have an <a href="#">issue tracker</a> set up with
            your repository, the commit dialog box lets you associate your commit
            action with an existing issue.</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Mercurial versioned files and folders must be recognized by the IDE
                as such in order to call Mercurial actions on them. To do so, you 
                must first <a href="mercurial-cloneother.html">clone</a> sources from an 
                external repository or <a href="mercurial-import.html">place the project</a>
                under Mercurial control.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to the repository:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a version-controlled file or folder (e.g. from the Projects,
                Files, or Favorites window) and choose Mercurial &gt; Commit from 
                the right-click menu. The Commit Dialog opens, listing all files that 
                contain local changes. If the files you want to commit do not already 
                exist in the repository, the commit action will add them.</li>
            <li>Enter a commit message in the Commit Message text area, indicating the 
                purpose of the commit.
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the Recent Messages icon (<img src="images/recent_msgs.png" 
                        alt="recent messages icon">) in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog to view recent commit messages.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Click Commit. The IDE executes the commit and sends your local changes to 
                the repository. You can also view files being commited to the 
            repository from the Output window (Ctrl-4).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When working in the Commit dialog, you can exclude individual files from a 
                commit. To do so, click on the Commit Action column for the specific file 
                and choose Exclude from Commit. The file name responds by displaying in 
                strike-through text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Updating Issues</h3>

        <p>You can update an issue by associating your commit action with an existing issue
            in your repository's issue tracker. To do so, click on the <strong>Update Issue</strong>
            heading in the Commit dialog box to expand it, then specify the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue Tracker</strong>: Specify the issue tracker that your repository
                uses, by selecting an issue tracker from the drop-down list. The drop-down
                provides you with a list of all issue trackers registered with the IDE. If
                your repository's issue tracker is not registered, click the <strong>New</strong>
                button to register it.</li>
            <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Specify the issue ID. You can do this by typing in
                the ID, or part of the description.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can also specify the following options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resolve as FIXED</strong>: Sets the issue's status as FIXED.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Commit Message from Above</strong>: Includes your above commit
                description in the update.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Revision Information to the Issue</strong>: Includes revision
                information, such as...</li>
            <li><strong>Add Issue Information to Commit Message</strong>: Appends issue
                information to the above commit description.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
        
        <p>If your local working directory includes files or directories that you do not 
            want to place under version control, you can set the IDE to ignore them 
            permanantly using the Ignore command.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You cannot employ the Ignore command on files that already exist in the 
                repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or directory you wish to ignore from the
                Projects, Files, Favorites, or 
                <a href="mercurial-statuswindow.html">Status</a> window.</li>
            <li>Choose Ignore (or Mercurial &gt; Ignore) from the right-click 
                menu of selected file or directory. The IDE ignores the file 
                or directory whenever Mercurial commands are called on it or 
                on the directory within which it is stored.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To change the status of ignored files so that they can be acted upon in 
                Mercurial, select the specific file and choose Mercurial &gt; Unignore.</li>
        </ul>
