when 'receiveFrom' contains regular expressions in it, 
those regular expressions will be used as filters filtering
out those directory/file entries that match the corresponding
regular expressions, for example:
if 'receiveFromHasRegexs' = FTP_IN_BOX/archive200[1-6]/invoice_[0-1][1-9]\.bak,
at the runtime, FTP BC will get a directory listing from FTP_IN_BOX,
iterate through each one of them and find the first match for regular expression
'archive200[1-6]', say archive2001, then get a directory listing from 
FTP_IN_BOX/archive2001, iterate through each one of them and find first match
for regular expression 'invoice_[0-1][1-9]\.bak', say, invoice_01.bak, now
FTP_IN_BOX/archive2001/invoice_01.bak is found as the first match,
and it will be used as the resolved value for 'receiveFrom', otherwise, 
if no match found for regular expression 'invoice_[0-1][1-9]\.bak',
FTP BC will go back to the parent level, and try the next match of 
'archive200[1-6]', and repeat the above process until found a path 
matching all the regular expressions as corresponding path components
or no matching path found after exhausted all paths under FTP_IN_BOX.</xs:documentation>

2. directory/file name replacement (%p/%f), usually used in 
pre/post operation's 'receiveFrom'/'sendTo' path.
For example, when 'sendTo' is my_in_box/invoice.dat, 
then a pattern like %p_backup/%f.bak will be my_in_box_backup/invoice.dat.bak
after expansion.
3. sequence number reference %#, this symbol will be replaced by the current
