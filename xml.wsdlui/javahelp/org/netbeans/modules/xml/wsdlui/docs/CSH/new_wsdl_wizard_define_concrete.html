<h2>New WSDL Document Wizard: Concrete Configuration</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The New WSDL Document wizard enables you to create a WSDL file from scratch. 
To open the wizard, you right-click the Process Files folder and choose New > WSDL Document.</p>

<p>The Concrete Configuration page prompts you to enter information about the binding, service, and port.</p>

<p>A <i>binding</i> contains protocol and data format information for the operations and messages of a port type. 
A <i>service</i> consists of one or more related ports. 
A <i>port</i> associates a binding with a network address, thus defining an individual endpoint that clients can access.</p>

<p>The Concrete Configuration page contains the following fields:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Binding Name.</b> Enter a name for the binding. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>

  <li><b>Binding Type.</b> Select the type of binding. 
  The appropriate extensibility elements will be added to the WSDL file. </li>

  <li><b>Binding Subtype.</b> The choices vary depending on the binding type.</li>

  <ul>

    <li>If you selected the HTTP binding type, then you must specify whether the binding uses the GET or POST verb and 
    whether message parts are encoded into the HTTP request URI using the standard URI-encoding rules or using a replacement algorithm.</li>

    <li>If you selected the SOAP binding type, then you must specify whether the operations are RPC-oriented or document-oriented and 
    how the message parts reference their types.</li>

    <li>For other binding types, you typically have only one choice for the binding subtype.</li>

  </ul>

  <li><b>Service Name.</b> Enter a name for the service. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>

  <li><b>Port Name.</b> Enter a name for the port. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you selected the SOAP binding type, 
  then the wizard checks for comformance to various requirements of the 
  Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile Version 1.1. 
  These requirements concern the RPC Literal and Document Literal binding subtypes. 
  If your settings for message parts and the binding subtype do not conform to these requirements, 
  then an error message appears at the bottom of the wizard page and the Finish button is disabled.</p>

<p>When you click Finish, the WSDL file is created. The WSDL Editor appears in WSDL view. 
  The tree structure includes nodes for the port type, operation, message(s), binding, service, and port 
  that you specified in the wizard.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>If you selected the SOAP binding type, then the port's <tt>soap:address</tt> node includes a Location property.
    The Location property specifies the address of the port. 
    The wizard generates a dummy value for the Location property. 
    The Location property must be unique; that is, the value must not conflict with any other WSDL files 
    that are deployed to the same application server.</li>
</ul>
