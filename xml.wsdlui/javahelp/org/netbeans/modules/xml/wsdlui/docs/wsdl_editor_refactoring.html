<h2>Using Refactoring to Rename or Delete WSDL Components</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>You can perform <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.bpel.help/org/netbeans/modules/bpel/help/design/refactoring.html" 
title="Refactoring in BPEL Processes">refactoring</a> by using the following approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rename.</b> Enables you to rename all occurrences in the associated XSD, WSDL, and BPEL files.</li>
  <li><b>Safely Delete.</b> Enables you to check for references to the component before you perform the delete.</li>
  <li><b>Undo.</b> After performing a Rename or Safely Delete action, you can undo that action.</li>
  <li><b>Redo.</b> After performing an undo of a Rename or Safely Delete action, you can redo that action.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also rename a component by changing the value of the Name property. The WSDL Editor renames all occurrences in the same file, but not in other files.</p>
