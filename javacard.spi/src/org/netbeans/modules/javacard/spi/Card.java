/**
 * A card or device to which Java Card applications can be deployed.
 * Most interaction with cards is accomplished by requesting interfaces
 * in this package from the Card's Lookup (or, for convenience, getCapability()).
 * <p/>
 * Any Java Card platform has a set of one or more Cards which projects can
 * be deployed to and interacted with in the IDE.
 * <p/>
 * The set of interfaces available at runtime depends on the card's <i>state</i>.
 * For example, a Java Card RI virtual Card can be <i>started</i> &mdash; which
 * literally means launching an emulator process the IDE can connect to.
 * When <code>Card.getState().isNotRunning()</code> is true, an instance of
 * <code>StartCapability</code> should be available from the Card.  When the
 * emulator process is launched, the instance of <code>StartCapablity</code>
 * disappears and an instance of <code>StopCapability</code> appears.
 * The presence or absence of capabilities determines the enablement of actions
 * in the UI for a Card.
 * <p/>
 * Base classes such as <code><a href="AbstractCard.html">AbstractCard</a></code>
 * and <code><a href="BaseCard.html">BaseCard</a></code> handle most of the
 * complexities of adding and removing capabilities in a thread-safe way.
 * <p/>
 * All cards should provide an instance of CardInfo in their lookup.
 * Other interfaces are optional, depending on the kind of device being
 * deployed to &mdash; for example, an emulator can be started and stopped,
 * so it makes sense for an emulator to provide instances of
 * <code>StartStopCapability</code>.  On the other hand, an actual card reader
 * which pretends, to the local computer, to be a network interface cannot
 * be asked to unplug itself, so a <code>StartStopCapability</code> for such
 * a card would make no sense.
 * <p/>
 * Common capability types provided are
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>CapabilitiesProvider</code> This interface provides the list of
 * other capability types this card supports.  If you are implementing Card
 * directly, it is not necessary, but the abstract support subclasses of Card
 * provided in this library require it.</li>
 * <li><code>CardInfo</code> &mdash; This provides basic user-visible information
 * such as display name, description and other user-visible attributes, and
 * should always be provided</li>
 * <li><code>StartCapability</code> &mdash; Cards which run on an emulator,
 * whose process can be started and stopped should provide an instance of
 * StartCapability</li>
 * <li><code>StopCapability</code> &mdash; Cards which run on an emulator,
 * whose process can be stopped should provide an instance of
 * StopCapability</li>
 * <li><code>ResumeCapability</code> &mdash; Cards which run on an emulator which
 * can be resumed after being stopped can optionally provide instances of
 * this interface</li>
 * <li><code>PortProvider</code> &mdash; provides an interface for determining
 * what ports on the local or remote host this device uses</li>
 * <li><code>CardCustomizerProvider</code> &mdash; Allows a Card instance to
 * provide a customizer component</li>
 * <li><code>ApduSupport</code> &mdash; provides a URL to a card manager,
 * application, value for the Contactless protocol to be used, and other
 * miscellaneous properties somewhat specific to the RI</li>
 * </ul>
