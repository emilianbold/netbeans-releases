/**
 * Interface which can be registered in the system filesystem, to allow
 * the user to define a device on a Java Card platform.  All platforms should,
 * if possible, create a default device when they are created, as it may
 * not be obvious to the user that they need to do this.
 * <p/>
 * Instances of this class are registered by <i>Platform Kind</i>.  Platform
 * kind is an ad-hoc string provided from JavacardPlatform.getPlatformKind().
 * For each platform kind there is a directory in the system filesystem, where
 * instances of AddDeviceHandler can be registered.  If more than one is present
 * for a given card kind, then the Add Device popup menu item will be a submenu
 * allowing the user to create multiple kinds of card.  In this way, the simplest
 * kind of alternate device integration can simply "hang" its own card definitions
 * off of the default instance of the Java Card RI, which can hijack Ant
 * deployment any way they want using an AntTargetInterceptor - without having
 * to implement JavacardPlatform and provide the Java Card API jars themselves.
 * <p/>
 * To add an AddDeviceHandler for a platform, place a <code>.instance</code> file or similar,
 * which can create an AddDeviceHandler subclass in the system filesystem (via
 * the module layer.xml file), in the folder
 * <pre>
 * org-netbeans-modules-javacard-spi/kinds/$KIND/
 * </pre>
 * (replacing <code>$KIND</code> with the actual value returned by
 * <code>JavacardPlatform.getKind()</code>).  For example, the path to register
 * your own factory for Card instances that run against the Java Card RI,
 * you would add a <code>.instance</code> file in
 * <pre>
 * org-netbeans-modules-javacard-spi/kinds/RI/
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Custom JavacardPlatform implementations should call <code>createAddDeviceAction()</code>
 * to include any registered AddDeviceHandlers in the list of popup menu actions
 * for their Nodes.
