/**
 * Service Provider Interface for Java Card Platforms.  Java Card Platforms
 * are registered as Java Platforms in the system filesystem, just as
 * instances on disk of the JDK which a project may be run against are.
 * <p/>
 * The Java Card Platform instance is responsible for providing the Java Card
 * API library classpath, which is used by Java Card projects for code
 * completion, compilation and debugging.
 * <p/>
 * A Java Card Platform provides one or more Cards which a project may be
 * deployed to.
 * <p/>
 * While a Java Card platform can be registered any way you choose, the
 * Java Card project modules (and particularly the Ant scripts) expect a
 * Java Card platform to be represented by a Properties-format file on disk, and
 * that file is read into the Ant environment by the project build script.
 * Note the distinction <i>properties-format</i> versus <i>properties-file</i>.
 * It is not required, and in fact, is inadvisable that the file <i>extension</i>
 * be <code>.properties</code>.  Instead, you will register your own file
 * extension (meaning that you provide the DataObject/Node/UI for files with
 * this extension), and make sure that an instance of JavacardPlatform can
 * be found in the Lookup of the DataObject.  For very simple cases, you may
 * be able to get away with just reusing the Java Card RI's built-in support
 * for properties files with the extension <code>.jcplatform</code>, and possibly
 * a custom factory for actual card instances (also properties-format files -
 * you will probably want your own file extension/data object type for these,
 * since the customizer for virtual cards for the RI allows things to be set
 * which cannot be changed in an actual piece of hardware).
 * <p/>
 * A module that wants to register a Java Card platform has several options.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Use the fairly flexible support for the Java Card RI to simply register
 * a properties-format <code>.jcplatform</code> file for the platform;  register
 * a factory for Card objects by platform kind, in the correct directory of the
 * system filesystem.</li>
 * <li>Register your own file type, which is in properties-format (the
 * Properties Based DataObjects module can handle most of this), and provides
 * a <code>JavacardPlatform</code> from its Lookup</li>
 * <li><i>For cards that really don't care that a project can never be deployed
 * via command-line+Ant:</i> provide a JavacardPlatform with Card instances which
 * provide an AntTargetInterceptor capability, and use the AntTargetInterceptor
 * to hijack load/instantiate/debug/etc. targets on the project, compile the
 * project, find the target JAR/CAP/etc. file and push it onto the device
 * however you want</li>
 * </ol>
