/**
 * Interface which can be available from a Card's Lookup/getCapabiliy() method,
 * which allows for
 * Card implementations to inject properties into an Ant process invoked from
 * the IDE, bypass target invocation altogether, and get notification once
 * a target has been successfully invoked.
 * <p/>
 * Card implementations can use this interface to
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provide properties for the Card as defined in the specification, which
 * may be consumed by Ant tasks.  For the Reference Implementation, there is
 * an actual Properties file on disk which is loaded by the Ant script.  An
 * implementation of an actual card might have no such properties file (since
 * physical devices may need such info computed on the fly), and instead inject
 * properties into the build which are required in order for the deployment or
 * instantiation tasks to function</li>
 * <li>A card may intercept invocation of the Ant task, and completely override
 * the project's action implementation to build the project some other way and
 * deploy whatever is necessary (this will make deployment outside the
 * IDE impossible, but that may be a non-issue for some vendors)
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Receive notification after a target has been run.
 * </li>
