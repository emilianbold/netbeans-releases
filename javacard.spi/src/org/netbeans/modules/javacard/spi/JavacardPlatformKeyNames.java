/**
 * The constants in this file are a list of keys which are found in properties
 * files.  A JavacardPlatform in NetBeans is stored as a properties file consisting
 * of key/value pairs.  This class defines the official properties which may be
 * found in such a file.
 * <p>
 * The Java Card Reference Implementation and other SDKs provide a template
 * file with some of these keys and values, as a file <code>platform.properties</code>,
 * underneath their root directory (the presence of a <code>platform.properties</code>
 * file is also how the IDE identifies a directory that might be a Java Card platform
 * in Tools &gt; Java Platforms, though additional mechanisms may be plugged in).
 * Such a template file will contain <i>relative</i> paths for classpaths and
 * similar, using some of the keys found as constants in this class.  When the IDE
 * installs such an SDK as a Java Card Platform, it will make its own internal
 * copy of this file, additionally translating paths to platform-specific absolute
 * paths and adding properties such as the user-entered display name for the
 * platform, its unique ID within NetBeans, a path for eeprom files if necessary,
 * etc.
 *  <p/>
 *  These are keys used in the .jcplatform (properties format) file that defines
 *  a platform, and the platform.properties file under the root of a Java Card
 *  SDK which is read and copied when that SDK is installed as a JavacardPlatform.
 *  They must match what any Ant script or task expects.
 * <p>
 *  All path and path-like properties in an SDK's platform.properties file
 *  should be relative paths using unix-style path-delimiters, e.g.
 *  <code>lib/foo.jar:lib/bar.jar</code>.  The IDE will translate these into
 *  fully qualified paths usable by Ant when it copies the platform.properties
 *  file into its own configuration on installation.
