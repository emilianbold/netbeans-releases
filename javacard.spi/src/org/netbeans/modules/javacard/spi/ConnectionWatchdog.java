/**
 * Utility class for use by Card implementations which need to poll a port,
 * make an http connection, run some executable, or otherwise poll to determine
 * the card's connected status.
 * <p>
 * To use, simply create an instance in your Card implementation's constructor,
 * and hold a reference to it;  implement ConnectionWatchdog.Callback to
 * handle long-running I/O and updating your Card instance.
 * <p>
 * What this class does in particular is handle the IDE's idle state
 * correctly:  When the user is using another application (i.e. no window
 * in the IDE has input focus), polling is shut down, to avoid interfering
 * with the performance of other applications when the user is doing
 * something else.
 * <p>
 * It also manages lifecycle correctly:  The passed Card instance is
 * weakly referenced.  Polling will stop if the Card instance is garbage
 * collected, and listeners on the main window which track activation
 * will be removed, thus avoiding memory leaks.
 *
