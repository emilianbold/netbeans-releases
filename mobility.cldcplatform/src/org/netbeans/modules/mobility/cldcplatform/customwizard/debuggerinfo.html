{argument} is a simple replacement, so for example {jadfile} will be replaced by the real path to the jad file.<br>
{argument|command line part} is a condition, if argument is set to some value the command line part will be added to the command line.<br>
Combination of condition and simple replacement is allowed. For example: {jadfile|-Xdescriptor:&quot;{jadfile}&quot;} means that if the jadfile argument contains /myfolder/my.jad then -Xdescriptor:&quot;/myfolder/my.jad&quot; will be added to the command line.<br>
