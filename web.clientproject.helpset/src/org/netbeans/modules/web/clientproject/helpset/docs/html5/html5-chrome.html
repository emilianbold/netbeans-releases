<h2>Integrating an HTML5 Project with a Browser</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>


<p>A NetBeans extension is available for the Chrome browser that enables the IDE and the 
    browser to communicate.
    To integrate the IDE with the Chrome browser you need to install the NetBeans Connector 
    extension from the Chrome Web Store or install the extension manually.
    After you install the extension you can perform the following tasks
    in the Chrome browser.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Inspect mode to select and locate elements in your code</li>
    <li>Debug JavaScript files</li>
    <li>Select various browser sizes from the NetBeans actions menu</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>After you install the extension, select Chrome with NetBeans Integration as the target browser
    and run the application. </p>

<ul class="note">
    <li>Do not close the infobar in the tab in the Chrome browser that informs you that
    "NetBeans Connector is debugging this tab".
    Closing the infobar will disconnect the IDE from the Chrome browser.
    To reconnect the IDE, close the tab where the application was running and re-run 
    the application from the IDE.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note.</strong> You only need to install the extension one time.</p>

<h3>Installing the extension from the Chrome Web Store</h3>
<p>Perform the following steps to install the NetBeans extension for the Chrome browser.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click an HTML5 project node in the Project Projects window and choose Properties in the popup menu. 
        <p>Alternatively, you can select a target browser for the project from the dropdown list in the toolbar.</p></li>
    <li>In the Run panel of the Properties window, select Chrome with NetBeans Integration in the server dropdown list. Click OK.</li>
    <li>Right-click the HTML5 project node in the Projects window and choose Run.
        <p>When you click Run the IDE opens a dialog that prompts you to install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.</p></li>

    <li>After the extension is installed in the Chrome browser, click the "Re-run Project" button 
        in the dialog box to open the HTML5 application in the Chrome browser.
        <p>You will see an infobar in the tab in the Chrome browser that informs you that
        "NetBeans Connector is debugging this tab".</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Installing the extension manually</h3>
<p>If you are unable to connect to the Chrome Web Store you can install the NetBeans Connector extension manually
by performing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open your Chrome browser to <tt>chrome://chrome/extensions/</tt>.</li>
    <li>On your local system, navigate to the <tt><em>NETBEANS_INSTALL</em>/ide/modules/lib</tt>
        directory, where <tt><em>NETBEANS_INSTALL</em></tt> is the installation of the IDE.</li>
    <li>Drag the NetBeans Connector extension (<tt>netbeans-chrome-connector.crx</tt>) 
        from the <tt>lib</tt> directory into the Extensions tab in the Chrome browser window 
        and approve the addition of the extension.</li>
    <li>Right-click the HTML5 project node in the Projects window and choose Run to open the 
        application in the browser.
    <p>You will see an infobar in the tab in the Chrome browser that informs you that
        "NetBeans Connector is debugging this tab".</p></li>
