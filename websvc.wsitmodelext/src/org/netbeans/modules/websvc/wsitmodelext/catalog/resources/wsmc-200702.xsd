                SHOULD be included on the returned message as an indicator

                The MakeConnection element is sent in the body of a one-way message that
                establishes a contextualized back-channel for the transmission of messages
                according to matching criteria (defined below). In the non-faulting case,
                if no matching message is available then no SOAP envelope will be returned
                on the back-channel. A common usage will be a client sending MakeConnection to
                a server for the purpose of receiving asynchronous response messages.

                        This element specifies the URI (wsa:Address) of the initiating Endpoint.
                        Endpoints MUST NOT return messages on the transport-specific back-channel unless
                        they have been addressed to this URI. This Address property and a message’s
                        WS-Addressing destination property are considered identical when they are exactly
                        the same character-for-character. Note that URIs which are not identical in
                        this sense may in fact be functionally equivalent. Examples include URI references
                        which differ only in case, or which are in external entities which have different
                        effective base URIs.
