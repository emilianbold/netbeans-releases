        <h2>Working with the Maven POM</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>The Project Object Model (POM) is the basic unit of work in Maven.
        The POM is described in the <tt>pom.xml</tt> XML file and contains project and configuration details,
        such as the artifact coordinates, project dependencies and build profiles that Maven uses to execute goals and build the project.</p>
        <p>For more information about POM elements, see the following pages on the Maven site:</p>
        
        <p>

        <p>When you use the New Project wizard to create an artifact, 
        the IDE automatically generates <tt>pom.xml</tt> and adds the artifact details.
        Open <tt>pom.xml</tt> in the XML editor to edit the file.
        The following features are available in the XML editor to help you edit <tt>pom.xml</tt>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code completion.</strong> The IDE's code completion can help you add and modify elements.
            The code completion hints offered in the editor are based on the contents of the repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Insert Code.</strong> The IDE can generate XML elements for you based on the
            details you specify in a dialog box.
            When you right-click in the editor window (Ctrl-I), a popup menu appears where you can choose to add a
            dependency, plugin or profile or exclude a dependency.
            A dialog box opens enabling you to specify the details about the code you want the IDE to insert.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dependency Graph.</strong> The IDE's Maven Dependency Graph is a visual representation of the
            direct and transitive dependencies specified in <tt>pom.xml</tt>.
            You can open the graph by right-clicking in <tt>pom.xml</tt> and choosing Show Dependency Graph.
            </li>
        </ul>
