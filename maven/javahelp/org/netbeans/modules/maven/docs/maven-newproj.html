        <h2>Creating a Maven Project</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>
        The New Project wizard enables you to create a new Maven project (artifact) based on an archetype in your local or
        a remote repository.
        When you create the new artifact the wizard prompts you to specify the 
        project coordinates (artifactId, groupId, versionId).
        </p>
        <p><strong>To create a new Maven project:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project from the main menu to open the New Project wizard.</li>
            <li>Choose the Maven category and then choose a Maven project template. Click Next.
            <p>If you choose the Maven Project template you will need to choose an archetype.
            The wizard displays the available archetypes contained in your local or registered remote repository.</p>
            
            </li>
            <li>Specify the project name, location and project details. Click Finish.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When you click Finish, the IDE creates the Maven project and displays the node for the project
        in the Projects window.</p>
        <p><strong>Notes.</strong></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you have only recently installed Maven, the first time you create a project
            the IDE may need to download the most recent artifacts into your local repository.
            This can take some time.</li>
            <li>If you choose an Enterprise Application template, the IDE will automatically
            create an assembly module for packaging the web application module and EJB module.
            You can select the modules that you want to create in the New Project wizard.</li>
            <li>If you have an existing Maven 2 project that contains <tt>pom.xml</tt> you do not need to use the New Project wizard.
            You can open the project by choosing Open Project (Shift-Ctrl-O) from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After you create the project, you can configure additional project properties by right-clicking the project
        node in the Projects window and choosing Properties.</p>
