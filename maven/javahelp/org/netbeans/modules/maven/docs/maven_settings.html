<h2>Configuring Maven Settings</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>You can configure Maven settings at the IDE level and at the project level.
At the IDE level you can configure Maven installation and repository details and define global Maven goals.
At the project level you can create configurations to activate Maven profiles and
bind IDE actions to Maven goals for a project.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Maven Settings for the IDE</h3>
<p>You configure Maven settings that effect the
behavior of Maven in the IDE in the Options window.
In the Options window you can specify your local Maven installation,
the location of the local Maven repository and settings for updating the repository.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the main window, choose Tools &gt; Options. </li>
  <li>Click the Miscellaneous category and then click the Maven tab.</li>
  <li>Modify the properties as desired. Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuring Maven Settings for Projects</h3>
<p>By using the project's Properties window you can configure Maven settings for an individual project.
You can create named configurations and then bind IDE actions to Maven goals and assign the
binding to a configuration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties. </li>
  <li>Cick the category in the left pane and modify the properties in the right pane. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Using Project Configurations</strong></p>
<p>The Configurations category enables you to enable and disable the configurations option for your project
and create new named configurations.
When enabled, you can easily create and activate any configurations that you create.
You can create configurations that can activate specific Maven profiles.
You can also use a configuration to map IDE actions to Maven goals.</p>

<p>Using a named configuration enables you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Load the project in the IDE with a customized set of dependencies or submodules.</li>
    <li>Trigger actions and activate any associated profiles.</li>
    <li>Customize IDE actions to map to Maven goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can switch to a configuration by right-clicking the project node in the Projects window and
choosing Set Configuration.
If your project is set as the main project in the IDE you can also
switch configurations using the drop-down list in the toolbar.</p>


<ul class="note">
    <li>If you do not enable configurations for your project, you can activate Maven profiles
    by right-clicking the project node and choosing Profiles from the popup menu.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Binding IDE Actions to Maven Goals</strong></p>

<p>You can use the Actions category in the Properties window to customize IDE actions by binding the action to Maven goals.
The Actions pane lists the IDE's default project actions that can be mapped to Maven goals.
You can assign the mapping to a project configuration if you activated configurations for the project.</p>
<p>After you select an IDE action you can modify the Maven goals and properties of the action by
typing in the textfield.
Actions are displayed in bold if the default values for the action have been modified.
The following textfields display the goals and properties associated with the selected action.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Execute Goals</strong> This field displays the Maven goals that are associated with
    the selected IDE action.</li>
    <li><strong>Activate Profiles</strong> This field displays any profiles that are activated when the action
    is invoked.</li>
    <li><strong>Set Properties</strong> This field displays the properties that are set on the command
    line. Properties are generally used to customize the behavior of the executed goal.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Creating Custom Actions</strong></p>
<p>You can create custom actions for a project by clicking Add Custom in the Actions category of the Properties window.
After you create the new action you can specify the goals or properties for the new action.
You can invoke the new action by right-clicking the project node in the Projects window and then choosing the
action under Custom in the popup menu.
</p>

<p>You can also create global custom goals for Maven projects by clicking Edit Global Custom Goal Definitions
in the Maven tab in the Options window.
The global goal is then listed in the popup menu under Custom when you right-click a Maven project in the Projects window.
