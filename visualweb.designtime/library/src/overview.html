<h2>The Java Studio Creator Design-Time API</h2>

<p>The Java Studio Creator Design-Time API provides component authors with access to the rich design-time interactions available in the visual design environment.  This API is essentially divided into two parts:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Interfaces that are implemented by the Sun Java Studio Creator IDE itself.  These interfaces are referenced by the component author in their design-time code to access the live component instances being designed and to retrieve contextual information.  These interfaces are discussed in section 2.1 of the user's guide document.<br><br>

<li>Interfaces to be implemented by the design-time classes supplied by the component author.  The Sun Java Studio Creator IDE uses these classes at design-time to perform the specified functions while the end user (the developer using the IDE) manipulates the components in the visual designer.  These interfaces are discussed in section 2.2 of the user guide document.
</ul></p>

<p>CDT was conceived and implemented as an integral part of the Sun Java Studio Creator IDE (the IDE). The initial version of the IDE focused on JavaServer FacesTM (JSF) components, but the Java Studio Creator Design-Time API was designed to handle JSF components, GUI components (like Swing), and beyond.  Due to time and resource constraints during development of the API, JavaServer Faces components received the greatest attention.  It is expected that this API will evolve as the Sun Java Studio Creator IDE provides support for client GUI and mobile application development in the future.</p>
