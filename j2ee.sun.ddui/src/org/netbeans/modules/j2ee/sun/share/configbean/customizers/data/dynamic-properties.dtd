    Description:
        Purpose of the document follows.
		
	DTD for definition of properties, their editors and validators to allow for
	name/value pair property editing to be handled nicely in the plugin.
-->

<!-- The file is a list of property lists -->
<!ELEMENT dynamic-properties (property-list*, validator*)>

<!-- Each property list can be fixed or editable and has a name -->
<!ELEMENT property-list (property-name, property-param+, help-id?)>
<!ATTLIST property-list editable CDATA "false"
						description CDATA "true"
						bundle-path CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!ELEMENT property-name (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
	Each element in a property list has a name.  It may also have a type, a
    validator, and possibly a min and/or max if the type is 'number'.  Lastly,
	it could have a helpId
-->
<!ELEMENT property-param (param-name, param-type, param-label?, param-validator?, default-value?, 
						  help-id?, param-description?)>

<!ELEMENT param-name (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
	There are four allowed types: boolean, text, number, and list.  The editable
	attribute is ignored for all types except the list type.
	
	For boolean properties, default value should be string using the boolean
	  'ENTITY' definitions in the sun-xxx dtd's, preferably true/false.
	For text properties, you should provide a validator (or none to allow
	  arbitrary text) and a default value if desired.
	For number properties, the number is assumed to be a signed long integer.
	  Use the min & max params to specify a range if required.
	For list properties, use as many param-value entries as necessary to represent
	  the list.  If the list is editable, set the editable attribute on the type.
	  One exception here is if the list is the list of charsets or locales, use
	  param-locale or param-charset to specify this.  These lists are provided by
	  the Locale and Charset classes in the JVM.

	(I'm not actually defining ENTITY's here because Schema2Beans does not support them.) 
-->
<!ELEMENT param-type ((param-value* | param-locale | param-charset), param-min?, param-max?)>
<!ATTLIST param-type type CDATA "text" 
					 editable CDATA "false"
					 required CDATA "true">

<!ELEMENT param-value (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT param-locale EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT param-charset EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT param-min (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT param-max (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	The text label (actually, will become bundle string id) to be used for the 
	value field instead of the word 'Value'
-->
<!ELEMENT param-label (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	Validators are used to ensure the text in a text field matches a specific
	pattern.  The following validators are supported:  (Can I support java
	regular expression patterns here?  It would make it lots easier!!!)
	
		directory:	A directory path specification
		javaid:		A legal java identifier (allows java keywords though)
		url:		A URL string
		domain:		A domain.  This is probably similar to javaid + represents a server domain
		package:	A legal java package name, e.g. javaid's separated by periods.
		memorysize:	A number followed by kb or mb (case insensitive)
		classid:	A windows classid (GUID)
-->
<!ELEMENT param-validator (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	String that will become the default value for the property.  If the property
	value must fit a specific pattern, the default-value must qualify.
-->
<!ELEMENT default-value (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	The help id for this field (or panel if specified at the property level,
	which is likely what we'll do.
-->
<!ELEMENT help-id (#PCDATA)>


<!--
	ID of string in bundle (see property-list attributes) to use for default
	description.
-->
<!ELEMENT param-description (#PCDATA)>

<!--  !PW this would be used by property-param once it's done

	Version of the appserver this property-param belongs to.  Not present means
	the property is applicable to all versions.
	
	Allowable Strings:  major[.minor][pe|se|ee]
		Major version is require.
		Minor is optional (not present matches all)
		Type is optional (not present matches all)
		
	For range attribute, valid values are:
		ending, only, starting
<!ELEMENT appserver-version (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST appserver-version range CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	Validator definition.  These are referred to by name from the <param-validator>
	entry in <property-param>, above.
