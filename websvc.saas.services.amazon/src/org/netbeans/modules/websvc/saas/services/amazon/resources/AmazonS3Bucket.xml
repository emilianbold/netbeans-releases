    Description:
        Purpose of the document follows.
        This document is an instance of component.xsd that describes the rest component
        "amazon map". This document describes the name, description, icons for the
        amazon map component. Classes element define the set of classes that to copied to
        users project from the location specified to the current target location
        of users file. The class files will be looked up using jdk 6 meta lookup. If 
        'instanceCreate' element is found on any class then the invocation of the 
        class will be added to the target class where this component will be dragged
        and dropped. In this case AmazonS3BucketResource.getMap() needs to do all the necessary 
        things to invoke whatever service it needs to (rest, jax-ws, jpa, ejb etc.,)
