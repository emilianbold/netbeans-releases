        <question id="arch-what">
            What is this project good for?
            <hint>
            Please provide here a few lines describing the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="arch-what">

    The 
    <api 
        type="export" name="ExplorerAPI" group="java" category="official" 
        url="@org-openide-explorer@/org/openide/explorer/doc-files/api.html" 
    />
    is build around Explorer - solely a user-interface device: it has no particular knowledge 
    of the structure of the IDE. Rather, it provides the physical user interface for 
    the Node hierarchy, as described in the 
    <api 
        type="import" name="NodesAPI" group="java" category="official" 
        url="@org-openide-nodes@/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html" 
    />.

    A given Explorer instance will be some visual component (such as a Swing panel) 
    displaying some representation of a subtree of the complete Node hierarchy; 
    the topmost node being displayed is said to be the root of the Explorer. 
    Be careful not to confuse the root of a particular Explorer instance, which is 
    selected according to what the user wishes to see, with the root(s) of 
    the entire Node hierarchy, which generally are fixed.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
The explorer does not implement any standards.
</answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions of itself? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
The only serializable object that might be part of some settings 
is <a href="@org-openide-explorer@/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html">ExplorerManager</a>
which serialization is backward compatible.

<!--
        <question id="dep-nb">
            What other NetBeans projects does this one depend on?
            <hint>
            If you want, describe such projects as imported API using
            the <code>&lt;api name="identification" type="import or export" category="stable" url="where is the description" /&gt;</code>

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may
            depend on such third-party library.
            </hint>
        </question>

            Do you deploy just module JAR file(s) or other files as well?
            <hint>
            If your module consists of just one module JAR file, just confirm that.
            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where they are located, how
            they refer to each other. 
            If it consist of module JAR(s) and other files, please describe
            what is their purpose, why other files are necessary. Please 
            make sure that installation/deinstallation leaves the system 
            in state as it was before installation.

<!--
        <question id="deploy-packages">
            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages
            </a>).

<!--
        <question id="deploy-shared">
            Do you need to be installed in the shared location only, or in the user directory only,
            or can your module be installed anywhere?
            <hint>
            Installation location shall not matter, if it does explain why.
            Consider also whether <code>InstalledFileLocator</code> can help.

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use

            Does your code use Java Reflection to execute other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.

            components?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resources provided by other modules in
            their layers?
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to
