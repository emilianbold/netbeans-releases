            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.

        The NetBeans launcher starts the application. Different launchers are
        provided for different supported platforms - Unix/Linux, Windows, and
        others. There are also a handful of classes in the
        <code>org.netbeans</code> and <code>org.netbeans.core</code> packages
        which directly support early startup features, such as command-line
        options.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

    <answer id="compat-i18n">
        Yes, except for early-startup code (including the native launcher) that
        deals with the command line.
    </answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implement or define any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or does it deviate somehow?

    <answer id="compat-standards">
        No.
    </answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.

            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.

<!--
        <question id="dep-jrejdk">
            Do you require the JDK or is the JRE enough?
        </question>
-->
    <answer id="dep-jrejdk">
        The launcher itself does not use the JDK. The Unix and windows launchers permit
        either the JDK or JRE to be specified - if the JRE is specified, modules
        with hard dependencies on JDK tools (e.g. the JPDA Debugger module) will
        simply not be loaded. For other launchers, unknown.

            the <code>&lt;api name=&quot;identification&quot; type=&quot;import or export&quot; category=&quot;stable&quot; url=&quot;where is the description&quot; /></code>

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

        The bootstrap code of course uses reflection to start the normal core.
        Currently some reflection is used in bootstrap class loaders to work
        around a variety of JRE bugs in handling loading from JAR files,

            used as last modification for the whole content of the cluster.

            <p>
            This file is ignored when accessing user directory, as it is expected

            If the cache is valid, it is loaded during startup and class
            and resource loading requests are redirected there.

                You may use
                    &lt;api type="export" group="preferences"
                    name="preference node name" category="private"&gt;
                    description of individual keys, where it is used, what it
                    influences, whether the module reads/write it, etc.
                    &lt;/api&gt;
                Due to XML ID restrictions, rather than /org/netbeans/modules/foo give the "name" as org.netbeans.modules.foo.
                Note that if you use NbPreferences this name will then be the same as the code name base of the module.
