/**
 * @class This class contains functions used to maintain focus and scroll position.
 * <p>
 * There can be an initial focus element and a default focus element. The
 * initial focus element is identifed by the "focusElementId" argument.
 * This argument is typically null on the first display of the page. If
 * the Body component is not preserving the focus then it may also be null,
 * at other times, since it represents the element id that last received
 * the focus before the request.
 * </p><p>
 * Whenever the page is displayed and "focusElementId" is null
 * "defaultFocusElementId" will receive the focus if it is not null. This id is
 * defined by the application using the Body "focus" attribute. If the
 * application wants to control the focus in all cases then it should set
 * the Body component "preserveFocus" attribute to "false". The application then
 * explicitly sets the Body "focus" attribute to the element id to receive
 * focus on every request/response.
 * </p><p>
 * In order to preserve focus across requests, the "focusElementFieldId"
 * element is used to preserve the id of the element that receives the focus
 * last. It is a hidden field that is submitted in the
 * request. See the "com.sun.webui.jsf.util.FocusManager" class for
 * information on how the focus is managed. This field exists in all
 * forms, since that it is the only way to guarantee that the last
 * element that received the focus is sent to the server. Which form
 * is submitted can never be known.
 * </p>
 * @constructor This function is used to construct a body object.
 * @param {String} viewId Used to name the scroll cookie
 * @param {String} path A member of the scroll cookie
 * @param {String} defaultFocusElementId The HTML element id that will receive focus.
 * @param {String} focusElementId The id of the element to receive the initial focus.
 * @param {String} focusElementFieldId The id of a hidden field to maintain
 * the id of the last element to have the focus.
 * @param {boolean} preserveScroll if true or not defined the scroll position is 
 * maintained else scroll is not maintained.
