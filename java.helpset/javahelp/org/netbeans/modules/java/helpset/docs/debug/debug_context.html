<h2>Current Context in the Debugger</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> The current context is the portion of your program on which the debugger
	is currently focusing. When multiple sessions are running, only one session
	is current. Within the current session, the thread
	from which the debugger regained control is the default current thread. Inside
	the current thread, the most recent call is the default current call. </p>
  
<p>You can make any session, thread, or call current by right-clicking its node 
  in the appropriate debugger window and choosing Make Current.</p>

  <h3>Debugger Windows and Context</h3>
        <p>Most debugger windows depend on the current context. When you change the
	current context, the contents of these windows are updated to reflect the new context. </p>
        <p>For example, the Debugging window shows the threads in the current session,
        while the Call Stack window shows the call stack for the current thread.
	The Variables window shows the variables that are local to the current
	call, and the Loaded Classes window shows the classes that have been loaded by the
	current session. </p>
        <p> The exceptions are the Breakpoints and Watches windows. These windows list 
        all breakpoints and watches set in the IDE. While the set of watches is shared 
        by all sessions, an individual watch expression is evaluated and displayed based 
        on the current context. </p>
        
        <a name="sourceeditor"></a>
        <h3>The Source Editor and Context</h3>
        <p> When a variable is active in the current context, the Source Editor displays 
        the value of the variable when you move the pointer over it. In cases where 
        a program includes different variables with the same name, the Source Editor 
        displays the value based on the current context, and not on the instance of 
        the variable in the source code. </p>
