<h2>Using the Call Stack</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Call Stack window lists the sequence of calls made during the execution
	of the current thread. By default, the Call Stack window opens automatically
  whenever you start a debugging session. </p>
<p>The information given for each call includes the name of the call, followed 
  by the file name and line number of the call's currently executing statement. 
  If the file name and line number are displayed in blue underlined text, then 
  the text is linked to the source code for that call. </p>
<p>You can open the Call Stack window at any time by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging  &gt; Call
Stack (Alt -Shift-3). </p>
<h3>Changing the Current Call</h3>
<p>The current call (marked by a <img src="images/CurrentFrame.gif" alt="Current frame icon"> 
  icon) is the most recent call made by the current thread. When you select a 
  different current thread, the Call Stack window is updated to show the calls 
  for that thread. The Local Variables window displays the values of variables 
  for the current call. </p>
<p><b>To browse the call stack, do any of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>To move one level away from the <tt>main</tt> routine, choose Run  &gt; Stack 
     &gt; Make Callee Current (Ctrl-Alt-up arrow). </li>
  <li>To move one level toward the <tt>main</tt> routine, choose Run  &gt; Stack 
     &gt; Make Caller Current (Ctrl-Alt-down arrow). </li>
  <li>To make a call current, double-click the call in the Call Stack window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can capture a textual representation of the call stack by right-clicking a a call and choosing Copy Stack from the pop-up menu.
When you copy the call stack, the text is copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the call stack into a text file.</p>
