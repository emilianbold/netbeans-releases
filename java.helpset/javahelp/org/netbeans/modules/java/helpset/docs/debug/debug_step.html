<h2>Stepping Through Your Program</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Once execution of your program is halted, you can step through your lines of 
  code using the following commands on the Debug menu or toolbar: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Step Over (F8).</b> Executes one source line. If the source line contains 
    a call, executes the entire routine without stepping through the individual instructions. </li>
    <li><b>Step Over Expression.</b><!-- TODO -- need description here--></li>
  <li><b>Step Into (F7).</b> Executes one source line. If the source line contains
  	a call, the IDE stops just before executing the first statement of the routine.
  	You can also start a debugging session with the Step Into command. Program
  	execution stops on the first line after the <tt>main</tt> routine before
  	any changes have been made to the state of the program. </li>
  <li><b>Step Out (Ctrl-F7).</b> Executes one source line. If the source 
        line is part of a routine, executes the remaining lines of the routine and 
        returns control to the caller of the routine. 
        The completed method call is highlighted in the Source Editor.</li>
    <li><b>Step Over Expression (Shift-F8).</b> Executes one method call in an expression.
        If an expression has multiple method calls, you can use Step Over Expression to step 
        through an expression and view the value of each method call in the expression in 
        the Local Variables window. Each time you use the Step Over Expression command, the debugger
        advances to the next method call in the expression and the completed method call is underlined. 
        Step Over Expression behaves like Step Over when there are no additional method calls.</li>
</ul>
<!--<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, the IDE steps over all calls to JDK classes. To step into JDK 
    classes when debugging, choose Window  &gt; Debugging &gt;  
    Sources (Alt-Shift-8). The sources window lists all of the source directories 
    on your project classpath. Check the checkbox for the JDK sources to let the 
    debugger step into the JDK sources. </li>
    
</ul>-->
