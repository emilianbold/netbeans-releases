<h2>Popping a Call From the Call Stack</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>
You can change the execution of your program so that the next statement to be executed is one of the 
calls made earlier on the stack.
In general, popping, or removing, a call from the call stack
does not undo any effects that the call caused.  For example,
if a call opened a database connection and then that
call is removed, the
database connection will remain open.
</p>
<ul class="note"><li>You can only pop a call if the program being debugged is paused.</ul>

<p><b>To pop the most recent call from the call stack:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the main menu, choose Run  &gt; Stack &gt; Pop Topmost Call. 
    <p> The call is removed from the call stack. The program counter is moved to the 
      line before the instruction that made the removed call. If the source code 
      is available, the focus of the Source Editor is set to that line. When you 
      continue program execution, the call is repeated.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>To pop multiple calls from the call stack:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Call Stack window, right-click the call that you want to remain at 
    the top of the call stack and choose Pop to Here.
    <p> All of the calls above the selected call are removed from the call stack. 
      The program counter is moved to the line before the instruction that made 
      the removed call. <!--question : what does made the removed call" mean?-->If the source code is available, the focus of the Source 
      Editor is set to that line. When you continue program execution, the call 
      is repeated.</p>  </li>
</ul>
