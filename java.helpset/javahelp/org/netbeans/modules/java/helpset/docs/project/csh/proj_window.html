        <p>The Projects window is the main entry point to your project sources. It shows 
            a logical view of important project contents such as Java packages and Web pages. 
            You can open the Projects window by choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1).</p>

        choosing View Java Packages As and then choosing one of the following

        <h3>Setting Main Projects</h3>
        
        <p>Whenever you have multiple projects open, one should always be set as the main 
            project. The main project is usually the project that contains an application's 
            main class. The IDE provides shortcut commands to quickly build, run, and debug 
            the main project. In the Projects window, the main project is shown in bold. 
            You can set any project as the main project by choosing Run &gt; Set Main Project
            from the main menu and selecting a project from the list of open projects in the sub-menu.</p>
