<h2>Encapsulating a Field</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
<p>Field encapsulation is the act of restructuring your code so that a field 
is accessed only by a pair of accessor methods. Accessor methods are 
also referred to as read/write methods or getters and setters.</p>
  <p>Typically when you encapsulate a field, you change the 
field's access modifier to <tt>private</tt> so that the field can not
be directly referenced from outside of the class. For other classes to 
reference the field, they have to use the accessor methods.</p>
<p>You can use the IDE's Encapsulate Fields command to:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Generate accessor methods for fields. The names of these methods 
     take the form of <tt>get<i>field-name</i></tt> and <tt>set<i>field-name</i></tt>.
     <li>Adjust the access modifier for the fields.</li>
     <li>Replace direct references in your code to the fields with 
     calls to the accessor methods.</li>
 </ul>

<p><b>To encapsulate a field:</b></a></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Source Editor, right-click a field or a reference to the field and choose 
    Refactor &gt; Encapsulate Fields 
    from the contextual menu. 
  <p>The <a href="csh/encapsulate-fields_db.html">Encapsulate Fields dialog box</a> 
  opens.</p></li>
  <li> In the List of Fields to Encapsulate table, make sure the checkbox for 
the field that you want to encapsulate is selected. You can select multiple fields.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Set the field's visibility.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Set the accessors' (getter and setter) visibility.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you do not want the IDE to replace code to use the accessor 
    methods, clear the Use Accessors Even When Field is Accessible checkbox. 
  <p>This option only has an impact if both of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have direct references to the field in your 
    code.</li>
    <li>You have set the field's accessor modifier so that the field is visible 
    to the classes with these references.</li>
</ul></li>
  <li>(Optional) If you do not want to review the changes before they are made, 
    clear the Preview All Changes checkbox.</li>
  <li>Click Next. If you have cleared the Preview All Changes checkbox, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps.</li>
  <li>The <a href="csh/previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. 
  </li>
  <li>(Optional) Double-click a file name in the Refactoring window to open the file, 
    or double-click a line of code to open the file and to put the insertion 
    point in that line of code.</li>
  <li>Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>
</ol>
    <ul class="note">
    <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
    	any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
    	node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
    </li>
  </ul>
