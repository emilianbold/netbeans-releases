        <h2>Move Inner to Outer Level Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Move Inner to Outer Level refactoring command.
        You can use the Move Inner to Outer Level command to move an inner class up 
        one level of hierarchy. </p>

        <p>You can open the Move Inner to Outer Level dialog box by choosing 
            Refactor &gt; Move Inner to Outer Level after you have selected an inner class in the 
            Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class Name.</b> Contains the name of the class to be moved.
            </li>
            <li><b>Declare Field for the Current Outer Class.</b> If selected, an 
                instance field for the current outer class will be generated and 
                the outer class will be passed to the constructor. If you select 
                this checkbox, type a name for the the outer class' instance field 
                in the Field Name text field.
            </li>
            <li><b>Field Name.</b> The name of the field to be created if the 
            Declare Field for the Current Outer Class is checked.</li>

            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you clear the Preview All Changes checkbox, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
