<h2>About Java Projects</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you build,
	 run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all Java development has to
	take  place within a project. For applications that involve large code bases,
	it is often advantageous to split your application source code into several
	projects.
<p>The IDE builds its project infrastructure directly on top of Apache Ant, the 
  leading build tool for Java applications. The IDE stores all of the information 
  about your project in an Ant script, a properties file, and a few XML configuration 
  files. This means that you can build and run your projects outside of the IDE 
exactly the same as inside the IDE. 
<p>The IDE includes several project templates designed to support different types
	of development including web applications, general
	Java applications, and so forth. The
	IDE's set of standard project templates  automatically generate
	an Ant script and properties.
	The IDE also contains a set of free-form project templates that you can use
	to base a project on an existing Ant script. 
	<ul class="note">
		<li>You do not need an in-depth understanding of Ant
		to work with the IDE as the
	 provided set of standard project templates automatically generate
	an Ant script and properties based on the options you enter in the IDE. If
			you need to base a project on an existing Ant script, you can use the
			included set of free-form project templates.</li>
	</ul>
