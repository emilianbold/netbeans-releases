<h2>Editing Source Files</h2>

<p>The IDE's built-in Source Editor enables you to 
view, create, and edit your source code.</p>

<p>You can open the Source Editor
window by double-clicking an editable element in the Projects window or by choosing
File  &gt; New to create a new file.</p>

<p>The IDE has many features to simplify coding of Java files such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Code completion</b>. 
    A dialog box appears and offers possible ways of completing the expression 
    you are typing.</li>
  <li><b>Code templates</b>. 
    You can enter common code snippets by typing abbreviations for those snippets.</li> 
  <li><b>Editor hints</b>. For some common coding mistakes, 
  the Source Editor provides hints for adding the missing code and offers to add the 
  code for you automatically.</li>
  <li><b>Word match</b>. After you type the beginning 
    characters of a word used elsewhere in your code, the Source Editor generates 
    the rest of the word.</li>
  <li><b><a href="../gui/gui_overview.html">GUI Builder</a></b>. Visually 
    design Java GUI applications.</li>
  <li><b><a href="../refactor/aboutRefactoring.html">Refactoring</a></b>. Change 
the structure of your code without changing the functionality.</li>
  <li><b><a href="editor_navigation.html">Navigation Shortcuts</a></b>. Include keyboard shortcuts that 
    enable you to navigate to a source file, declaration statement, or Javadoc 
    documentation based on the location of the insertion point. </li>
  <li><b>Code Folding</b>. Enables you to hide 
    sections of code, such as Javadoc comments and method bodies.</li>
  <li><b>Pair Completion, Smart Enter, and 
    Smart Semicolons</b>. When you type a quotation mark, bracket, brace, 
    or parenthesis, the Source Editor automatically inserts the closing character. 
    The matching is "smart", so the closing characters are not duplicated if you 
    type them yourself.</li>
  <li><b>Code templates and macros</b>. Use built-in 
  code templates and macros to quickly generate common code snippets. You can also 
  create your own code templates and macros.</li>
  <li><b>Import Management</b>. The Alt-Shift-I keyboard 
    shortcut helps you generate an import statement for the class you are typing and 
the Alt-Shift-F command adds all missing import statements for the entire file.</li>

</ul>


<ul class="note">
<li>You can find information about other Source Editor features in help topics that 
are specific to the type of application you are developing.</li>
</ul>
