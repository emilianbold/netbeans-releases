<h2>About Refactoring</h2>
<p>Refactoring is the use of small transformations to restructure code without changing 
 any program behavior. Just as you factor an expression to make
	 it easier to understand or modify, you refactor code to make it easier to
	read, simpler to understand, and faster to update. And just as a refactored
	expression must produce the same result, the refactored program must be functionally
	equivalent with the orginal source.</p>
<p>Some common motivations for refactoring code include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making the code easier to change or easier to add a new feature</li>
  <li>Reducing complexity for better understanding</li>
  <li>Removing unnecessary repetition</li>
  <li>Enabling use of the code for other needs or more general needs</li>
  <li>Improving the performance of your code</li>
</ul>
<p>The IDE's refactoring features simplify code restructuring by evaluating the 
changes that you want to make, showing you the parts of your application that 
are affected, and making all necessary changes to your code. For example, 
if you use the Rename operation to change a class name, the IDE finds every 
usage of that name in your code and offers to change each occurrence of that 
name for you.
