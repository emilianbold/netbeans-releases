        <h2>About Actions in the Swing Application Framework</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
            
            <p>The Swing Application Framework provides support to help you 
            define and manage actions.</p> 
            <p>In the framework, an action is a method that is marked with the  
            <tt>&Action</tt> annotation. The framework then uses 
            that method to perform the given action. You can also specify 
            various attributes for the action that determine things such as 
        the enabled state of the action, the action's blocking behavior, and 
    whether the action runs in the background.</p>
        <p>In the IDE, you can use  
            <a href="gui_saf_action_csh.html">Set Action dialog box</a> to 
            generate code for actions, including the annotation and any 
            attributes. In 
        the Set Action dialog box, you can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set a component to use an action.</li>     
            <li>Create skeleton actions.</li>
            <li>Configure user interface properties for the action, such as 
                the name to appear on the visual component, tool tip text, 
            and keyboard shortcuts.</li>
            <li>Create a Boolean property to determine whether the 
            action is enabled.</li>
            <li>Create a Boolean property to determine whether the 
                action is selected. (This only applies to non-menu components 
                that have a <tt>selected</tt> property, such as radio buttons.)            
            </li>    
<li>Set an action to run as a background task.</li>   
<li>Configure an action to block other actions until it completes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To open the Set Action dialog box, do one of the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click a component and choose Set Action.</li>
            <li>Select a component and click the ellipsis (...) button next to 
            its <tt>action</tt> property in the Properties window.</li>
        </ul>
        
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>        
        <ul class="note">
<li>When you assign an action to a component, that component's  
<tt>text</tt>, <tt>toolTipText</tt>, and <tt>icon</tt> properties are set according 
to what you have entered in the Set Action dialog box. If you have previously set 
these properties for the component, they 
will be replaced by what is specified in the Set Action dialog box. However, you 
can return to the property sheet for the component and customize the values that 
you want for that component. In the running application, the component-specific 
properties will be used.</li>
<li>By default, resources for the action are stored in a <tt>.properties</tt> 
file that has the same name as the action's <tt>.java</tt> file. 
The property keys 
are derived from the action name. The affected attributes are text, tooltip, 
accelerator, small icon, large icon, blocking title, and blocking message.</li>
        </ul>
