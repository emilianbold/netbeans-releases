        <h2>Extracting an Interface</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>When you use the Extract Interface command, the 
IDE creates a new interface from the selected public non-static methods in a class or interface.
	
        <!-- TODO post50 why create interface: Typically you create an interface when you want to  -->

        Because an interface does not restrict how its methods are implemented, interfaces can be used in classes that have different functions.
        Creating interfaces can increase the reusability of your code as you can have multiple classes implementing the same interface.
        If necessary, you can then modify the interface instead of making modifications in multiple classes.</p>
	    
        <p>When you extract an interface, the IDE does the following things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a new interface with the selected methods in the same package as the current class or interface.</li>
            <li>Updates the <tt>implements</tt> or <tt>extends</tt> clause of the current class or interface to include the new interface. 
            Any interfaces that the new interface extends are excluded.</li>
        </ul>
	
        <p><b>To extract an interface:</b></a></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the class or interface containing the methods you want to move to an interface.</li>
            <li>In the Source editor, right-click in the file and choose Refactor &gt; Extract Interface.</li> 
            <p>The Extract Interface dialog box opens.</p></li>
            <li>Type the name for your interface in the Interface Name text field.</li>
            <li>In the Members to Extract list, select the members that you want to extract to the new interface.
            <p>If the class from which you are extracting an interface already implements an interface, there 
            is also an item for that implemented interface. If you select the checkbox 
            for that interface, the <tt>implements</tt> clause for that new interface 
            is moved to the new interface that you are extracting.</p></li>
            <li>(Optional) Clear the Preview All Changes checkbox if you do not want to preview the changes before they are made.
            If Preview All Changes is not selected, the IDE applies the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps.</li>
            <li>Click Next. 
            If Preview All Changes was selected, the Refactoring window opens and displays all occurrences that will be affected by the change.
            Review the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. </li>
            <li>Click Do Refactoring in the Refactoring window to apply the changes to the selected files.</li>
        </ol>
