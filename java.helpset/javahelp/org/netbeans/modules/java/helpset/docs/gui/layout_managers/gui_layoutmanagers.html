        <h2>About  Layout Managers</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Layout managers enable
        you to control the way in which visual components are arranged in GUI forms
        by determining
        the size and position of components within containers. This is accomplished by
        implementing the <tt>LayoutManager</tt> interface. 
        <p>By default, new forms created with the GUI Builder use
        a FreeDesign paradigm which enables you to lay out your form using
        visual guidelines that automatically suggest optimal alignment and spacing
        of components. As you work, the GUI Builder
        translates your design decisions into a functional UI without requiring
        you to specify a layout manager. Because FreeDesign employs a dynamic layout
        model, whenever you resize the form or switch locales the GUI adjusts to
        accommodate your changes without changing the relationships between components. 
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li>In order for the interfaces you create with the GUI Builder to work
            outside of the IDE, the Swing Layout Extensions library must be on the 
            classpath at runtime. To simplify the process of deploying of your 
            GUI applications, the IDE automatically copies the JAR (and any other JAR 
            files on the project's classpath) to the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder 
            when you build the project. The IDE also adds the JAR 
            to the Class-Path element in the application JAR file's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
            file to simplify running the application outside the IDE. For more information, 
            see <a href="../gui_deploying.html">Deploying Java GUI Applications</a>.</li>
        </ul>  
        
        <h4>Layout Managers provided in the IDE</h4>
        <p>If you are working with forms created in earlier
        versions of the IDE or want your form to be compatible with 
        standard Java classes, for example, you can specify a layout manager for your
        forms.</p>
        <p>You can choose from the  following Layout Managers  in the IDE: </p>
        <ul>

            <li><b>FlowLayout</b>
            <p>
                FlowLayout&nbsp;(<img src="../images/flowLayout.gif" alt="FlowLayout icon">)
                arranges components in a container like words on a page. 
                It fills the top line from left to right until no more components can fit, 
                continuing the same way on each   successive line below.
            </p>
            <li><b>BorderLayout</b>
            <p> BorderLayout (<img src="../images/borderLayout.gif" alt="BorderLayout icon">)
            arranges components along the edges or the middle of their container. Using
            BorderLayout, you can place components in five possible positions: North,
            South, East, West, and Center corresponding to the container's top, bottom,
            right and left edges and interior area. </p>
            <li><b>GridLayout</b>
            <p>
            GridLayout&nbsp;(<img src="../images/gridLayout.gif" alt="GridLayout icon">)
            places components in a grid of equally sized cells, adding them to the grid from
            left to right and top to bottom. </p>
            <li><b>GridBagLayout</b>
            <p>
                GridBagLayout&nbsp;(<img src="../images/gridBagLayout.gif" alt="gridBagLayout icon">)
                is a powerful layout manager
                that provides precise control over all aspects of the layout even when
                the container is resized, using a complex set of component
                properties called "constraints."  
                It is particularly useful for multiplatform Java
                applications as it enables you to create a free-form layout that 
                maintains a consistent appearance across platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
            GridBagLayout places components in a grid of rows and columns  in which  grid
            cells do not all have to be the same size.
            In addition, components
            can span multiple rows,  columns, or both. For more information about using
            GridBagLayout see <a href="gui_gbcustomizer.html">Using the GridBag Customizer</a> . </p>

            <li><b>CardLayout</b>
            <p> CardLayout (<img src="../images/cardLayout.gif" alt="CardLayout icon">)
            provides a means of managing two or more components  occupying the same
            display area. When using CardLayout each component is like a card in a
            deck, where all cards are the same size and only the top card is visible
            at any time. Since the components share the same display space, at design
            time you must select individual components using the Inspector window. </p>
            <li><b>BoxLayout</b>
            <p> BoxLayout (<img src="../images/boxLayout.gif" alt="BoxLayout icon">) allows
            multiple components to be arranged either vertically or horizontally, but
            not both. Components managed by BoxLayout are arranged from left to right
            or top to bottom in the order they are added to the container. Components
            in BoxLayout do not wrap to a second row or column when more components
            are added or even when the container is resized. </p>
            <li><b>AbsoluteLayout</b>
            <p> AbsoluteLayout &nbsp;(<img src="../images/absoluteLayout.gif" alt="AbsoluteLayout icon">)&nbsp;is
            a special IDE layout manager that enables  components to be placed exactly
            where you want them in the form, move them around in the IDE, and resize
            them using their selection borders. It is particularly useful for making
            prototypes since there
            are no formal limitations and you do not have to enter any
            property settings. However, it is not recommended for production applications
            since the fixed locations and sizes of components do not change with the
            environment.</p>
            <ul class="note"> 
                <li> To distribute an application with the IDE's
                AbsoluteLayout manager, you must include  the IDE's AbsoluteLayout
                classes, as these are not part of the standard Java layout sets.
                These classes are ready for deployment in <tt>&lt;install-dir&gt;/ide8/modules/ext/AbsoluteLayout.jar</tt>. 
                <!--<p> The source code is also redistributable. It is available in the files 
                <tt>AbsoluteLayout.java</tt> and <tt>AbsoluteConstraints.java</tt>, found 
                in <tt>&lt;install-dir&gt;/sources/org/netbeans/lib/awtextra</tt>. --></li>
            </ul>


            <li><b>Null Layout</b>
                <p>
                    The Null Layout (<img src="../images/nullLayout.gif" alt="nullLayout icon">)
                    is used to design forms without any layout manager at all.  
                    Like the AbsoluteLayout, it is useful for making quick prototypes but is not
                    recommended for production applications, as the fixed locations and sizes of
                    components do not change when the environment changes.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
