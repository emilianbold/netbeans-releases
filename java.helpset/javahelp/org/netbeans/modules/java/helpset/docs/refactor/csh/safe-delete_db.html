        <h2>Safe Delete Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
    <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Safe Delete refactoring command.
        You can use the Safely Delete command to have the IDE check to make sure that 
the code element that you want to delete is not being used by other code. If the code 
    element is not used, the IDE deletes the code element.</p>
        <p>You can open the Safe Delete dialog box by choosing Refactor &gt; Safely Delete  
            after you have selected a code element in the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>       

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Safely delete.</b> Label listing the code elements that you have selected 
            for deletion. If the code elements do not correspond with the elements that you intend 
            to delete, click Cancel.      
            </li>
            <li><b>Search in Comments.</b> If selected, you will be warned if the code 
            element to be deleted appears in a comment.
            </li>
          
        </ul>

       <p>If you want to preview the changes, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Preview. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
