        <h2>Organizing Spring Configuration Files</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>The IDE provides support for organizing Spring configuration files. This support
            allows you to specify all your configuration files and organize them into
            groups, so that they can refer to each other in features such as code completion 
            and hyperlinking. The Spring Configuration Group panel, located in the Project
            Properties window, enables you to organize Spring configuration files.</p>

        <p><strong>To access the Spring Configuration Group panel:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the Spring support has been enabled, for example by <a href="add-support.html">adding 
                the Spring Framework library</a> to the project.</li>
            <li>Right-click on the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties.</li>
            <li>Under Categories, select Spring Framework.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The Spring Framework category contains two tabs: Configuration Files and Configuration File
            Groups. The Configuration Files tab lists all the Spring configuration files in a project,
            and the Configuration File Groups lists all configuration file groups.</p>

        <p><strong>Specifying Spring configuration files</strong></p>

        <p>Select the Configuration Files tab. You can use the Add File and Remove File buttons to
            add and remove files from the list, or you can use the Detect Files button to let the
            Spring support try to autodetect the configuration files.</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Files created using the <a href="create-config-file.html">New Spring XML
                Configuration File wizard</a> are added to this list automatically by the wizard.</li>            
            <li>If you do not mention a configuration file here, it will be ignored by the Spring 
                features that process all Spring configuration files in the project, such as 
                refactoring. Features which work in single files, such as code completion, will 
                continue to work. It is good practice to specify all your configuration file in 
                this list.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Organizing the Spring configuration files into groups</strong></p>

        <p>Groups are useful for setting up parent/child relationships between configuration files.
            For example, in a web application is is typical to have a
            <tt>applicationContext.xml</tt> file containing business logic service beans, and a
            <tt>spring-servlet.xml</tt> file containing Spring Web MVC beans such as controllers.
            The beans in <tt>spring-servlet.xml</tt> are often initialized with service beans from
            <tt>applicationContext.xml</tt>, and this fact needs to be reflected in features such 
            as code completion and hyperlinking. In order to set up such a relationship, you would
            create a group containing these two files.</p>

        <p>Select the Configuration File Groups tab. You can use the Add Group, and Remove Group
            button to add and remove groups. After adding a group, you can add/remove files
            to/from it using the Add Files and Remove Files buttons.</p>
