        <h2>About Beans Binding in Java Desktop Applications</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The IDE supports the Beans Binding specification (JSR 295), 
            which enables you to synchronize the values of properties of different beans. 
        This feature is useful in desktop applications for things such as the following:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Creating database applications.</li>
            <li>Incorporating web services into applications.</li>
            <li>Creating dynamic interaction between visual components.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To take full advantage of the IDE's beans binding support, use the 
            IDE's <a href="gui_about.html">GUI Builder</a>.  
            You can open the GUI Builder in either of the 
        following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project, select the Java category, and 
            create a project with the Java Desktop Application template.</li>
            <li>In another type of Java project, choose File &gt; New File and 
            select any of the templates in the Swing GUI Forms category.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the GUI Builder is open, you can generate bindings for 
        components by using the 
        <a href="csh/gui_bind_dialog.html">Bind dialog box</a>. The Bind dialog box 
        enables you to designate a source for the binding and generate 
        other necessary code for the binding, such as converters or validators. 
        Open the Bind dialog box by right-clicking the component that you want 
        to be the target of the binding and choosing the appropriate 
        property from the Bind submenu.</p>


        <p>When using the Bind dialog box, the IDE generates binding code that 
            contains Expression Language syntax. This syntax makes it 
        easy to bind simple properties, nested properties, and expressions.</p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>As of JDK 6, the Beans Binding library is not a part of the JDK. 
                Applications that use beans binding need to be packaged with 
                the Beans Binding JAR file. When you create bindings using the 
                IDE's Bind dialog box, the IDE adds the Beans Binding JAR file to your 
                project automatically. When you build your project, you can find the 
            JAR file in the project's <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder.</li>
        </ul>
