        <h2>Previewing a Form</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p> To quickly test how your form will be displayed when it is compiled and run,
        click the Test Form button in the GUI Builder toolbar. A dialog box is displayed
        with  the components arranged as they would actually appear on your form. </p>
        <p> When you click in a Testing Form dialog box, mouse events are delivered
        to the actual components and you can see the components "in action."  Thus,
        for example, you can move sliders, type into text fields, and buttons look "pressed" when
        you click them, however, cross-component
        and event handling code is not executed. </p>
        <p><b>To test your form without compiling and running it:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the Preview Design button <img src="images/test_form.png" alt="Image of the Preview Form button"> 
            located in the GUI Builder toolbar.
                <p>The IDE displays the form in the Preview window enabling you to 
                test the behavior of your GUI. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you update your form, close any open form Preview windows 
            and click the Preview Design button again to see your changes. </li>
        </ul>
