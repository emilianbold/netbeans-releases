<h2>Debugging Threads in the IDE</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>All the threads created in the current session are displayed in the Debugging window.
  You can open the Debugging window by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging &gt; Debugging (Alt-Shift-9).</p>
  
<h3>Changing the Current Thread</h3>
<p> Only one thread is the current thread at any given time. By default, the
	current thread is the thread within the current session from which the debugger gained control. 
        When you switch between threads to debug, the Local Variables window is
        automatically updated to reflect the data applicable to that thread. </p>
        
<p><b>To change the current thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click any thread in the Debugging window to make it the current thread. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suspending and Resuming Threads</h3>
<p> You can suspend execution of a thread if you think it is causing problems
  and then later resume the thread once the problem is solved. </p>
<p>In the Debugging window, the icon to the left of the thread name indicates whether the thread
is suspended or waiting to be resumed.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
		<th scope="col">Icon</th>
		<th scope="col">Description</th>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/CurrentThread.gif" alt="Current thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates the current thread</td>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/RunningThread.gif" alt="Running thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates a thread that is running and is not current</td>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/SuspendedThread.gif" alt="Suspended thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates a thread that is suspended and is not current</td>
	</tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can display the Suspend property as a boolean flag (True or False) 
        in the Threads window by clicking the columns button 
        (<img src="images/ChangeColumn.gif" alt="Change Column">) and select the Suspend checkbox. </p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>  The state of the Thread is independent of whether the thread is suspended
  	or waiting to be resumed. A thread's state may be Running while the Suspend
  	property is True. </li>
  </ul>
<p><b>To suspend or resume a thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose the Resume or Suspend command. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-threaded Applications</h3>
<p>When debugging a multi-threaded application, a step in a particular thread may be interrupted by
    a breakpoint encountered in some other thread.
This behavior is desirable in some cases but not in others.</p>

<p>Let us suppose you are stepping through a thread (<i>thread 1</i>), 
and one of the steps is interrupted by a breakpoint encountered in another thread (<i>thread 2</i>).
When this happens, the program counter is set to the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.</p>

<p>You can continue stepping through your program in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Continue stepping through your program from the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.</li>
    <li>Step through the program from the previous step (in <i>thread 1</i>) and ignore the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.    
    <p>To continue with the step in <i>thread 1</i>, do one of the following in the Threads window: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Click Ignore Breakpoint.</b> Clicking this will cause the 
        debugger to ignore the specified breakpoint encountered in <i>thread 2</i> and you can continue to step
        through the program following <i>thread 1</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Click Ignore All Such Breakpoints.</b>
        Clicking this will cause the debugger to ignore all breakpoints that would interrupt a step in progress.
        If clicked, the IDE ignores such breakpoints until the end of the debugging session.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h3>Viewing Source Code for a Thread</h3>
<p>You can view the source code of a thread in the IDE's Source Editor if you
think it is causing problems and want to examine it further.</p> 
<p><b>To view a thread's source:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose Go To Source. 
      <p> If the source of the thread is available, the Source Editor jumps to the 
      current call on the thread's call stack. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
