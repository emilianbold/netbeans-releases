        <h2>Set Action Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        
        <p>You use the Set Action dialog box to assign actions to visual 
            components, such as menu items and buttons. In the dialog box, you also
            set resources for those actions, such as the text that appears on 
            the component, tool tip text, and any icons that you want to associate with 
            the action. Such resources are saved in a <tt>.properties</tt> file that is named 
        after the class that contains the action.</p>
        
        <p>You open the Set Action dialog box in one of the following two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-clicking a component in a Java Desktop Application project and 
            choosing Set Action.</li>  
            <li>Select a component in a Java Desktop Application project and right-click 
            the ellipsis (...) button next to the <tt>action</tt> property in the Properties 
            window.
        </ul>
        <p>The Set Action dialog box consists of the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Set Action Property Using</b>. Enables you to select from 
                different property editors to set the <tt>action</tt> property. The 
                choices are the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Default editor</b>. Provides visual support for 
                    taking generating code that is based on Swing Application framework features. </li>
                    <li><b>Value From Existing Component</b>. Enables you to specify 
                    a component from which to derive the property's value. </li>
                    <li><b>Custom Code</b>. Provides a text area for you to  
                    manually write the code for setting the property. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This help topic only covers the options in the default editor.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Action</b>. Select an action from combo box to assign to the 
                component. 
                <p>Only methods that have the <tt>@Action</tt> annotation 
                    are listed in the combo box. If you have a method that you want 
                    to use that does not have this annotation, exit the dialog box and add that 
                annotation to the method.</p>
                <p>If you have not yet written a method for the action, select Create New Action. 
                    This enables you to enter a method name in the Action's Method field. 
                    Also be sure to fill in the Text field with the text that you want 
                    to appear on the component. When you 
                click OK to exit the dialog box, a skeleton action is created for you.</p>
                
                <p><b>Note:</b> When you assign an action to a component, that component's  
                    <tt>text</tt>, <tt>toolTipText</tt>, and <tt>icon</tt> properties are set according 
                    to what you have entered in the Set Action dialog box. If you have previously set 
                    these properties for the component, they 
                    will be replaced by what is specified in the Set Action dialog box. However, you 
                    can return to the property sheet for the component and customize the values that 
                    you want for that component. In the running application, the component-specific 
            properties will be used.</p>  </li>  
            
            <li><b>Action's Class</b>. If you are creating a new action, use this 
            combo box to select the class in which to place the action.</li>
            <li><b>Action's Method</b>. If you are creating a new action, use this 
            text field to name the action method to be generated.</li>
            <li><b>Background Task</b>. If selected, the action is run in the background. 
                This is useful if the action might take a long time to complete and you 
            want the user to be able to do other things in the UI while the action completes.</li>                
            <li><b>Attributes, Basic Tab:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Text</b>. Type the text that you want to be used for the 
                    action in visual components, such as buttons and menu items.</li>
                    <li><b>Tool Tip</b>. Type any text that you would like to appear 
                    when the user mouses over any components associated with the action.</li>
                    <li><b>Accelerator</b>. Provide a keyboard shortcut for the action. To 
                        specify the shortcut you want to use, select the Letter field and 
                        type the shortcut as you 
                        would when using the shortcut. The checkboxes for any modifier keys 
                        that you use, such as Ctrl and Shift, are selected automatically.
                    </li>    
                    <li><b>Icon</b>. If desired, associate icons for the action. 
                        Use the Small Icon and Large Icon buttons to navigate to the icons 
                    that you want to use.</li>            
            </ul>            </li>
            <li><b>Attributes, Advanced Tab:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Enabled Property</b>. If desired, select a Boolean 
                        bean property, the value of which determines whether the 
                        action is enabled or not. If you have not yet created such a property, 
                        type a name for the property in the text field. After you click OK 
                    to exit the dialog box, a skeleton property will be created for you.</li>
                    <li><b>Selected Property</b>. If desired, select a Boolean 
                        bean property, the value of which determines whether the 
                        action is selected or not. This option only applies to 
                        components that have a <tt>selected</tt> bean property, such as JRadioButton and 
                        JToggleButton. After you click OK 
                    to exit the dialog box, a skeleton property will be created for you.</li>
                    <li><b>Blocking Type</b>. Enables you block user interaction 
                        with the user interface while a task is completing. 
                        The choices in the drop-down list enable you to set the level 
                        at which the blocking applies. For example, you can block the whole application 
                        or just a window or component. Blocking types only apply to 
                        actions that you have specified as background tasks.
                    </li>    
                    <li><b>Blocking Dialog Title</b>. Specify a title for the dialog 
                    box that appears to warn the user that a task is not yet completed.</li>    
                    <li><b>Blocking Dialog Message</b>. Specify text to show in the dialog 
                    box that appears to warn the user that a task is not yet completed.</li>                            
            </ul>            </li>
            
            
        </ul>
