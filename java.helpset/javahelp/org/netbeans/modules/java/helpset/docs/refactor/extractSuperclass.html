        <h2>Extracting a Superclass</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

	    
        <p>When you extract a superclass, the IDE does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a new class with the selected methods and fields in the selected class.
            You can also have the new class implement interfaces that are implemented in the selected class.
            <p>If the selected class extends a class, the new class also extends the same class.</p></li>
            <li>The selected class is modified so that it extends the new superclass. All selected interfaces are removed from the <tt>implements</tt> clause.</li>
            <li>Removes the selected <tt>public</tt> and <tt>protected</tt> fields from the base class.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can preview the files that will be changed  by selecting Preview All Changes in the Extract Interface dialog box.
            If Preview All Changes is selected, a list of the files to be modified is displayed in the Refactoring window.
            If you do not want certain occurrences to be changed, you can clear the checkbox for that occurrence in the Refactoring window.
            Double-clicking on an occurrence opens that file in the Source editor, and the caret is placed in the line containing the occurrence.</li>
        </ul>   
	
        <p><b>To extract a superclass:</b></a></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the class containing the methods or fields you want to move to the new superclass.</li>
            <li>In the Source editor, right-click in the file and choose Refactor &gt; Extract Superclass.</li> 
            <p>The Extract Superclass dialog box opens.</p></li>
            <li>Type the name for your new superclass in the Superclass Name text field.</li>
            <li>Select the members you want to extract to the new superclass.</li>
            <li>(Optional) If you want to make a method abstract, select the Make Abstract checkbox for the method. 
            If you select this checkbox, the method will be declared in the superclass as an abstract method and overridden in the current class. 
            The method will be assigned the <tt>protected</tt> access modifier.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Clear the Preview All Changes checkbox if you do not want to preview the changes before they are made.
            If Preview All Changes is not selected, the IDE applies the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps.</li>
            <li>Click Next. 
            If Preview All Changes was selected, the Refactoring window opens and displays all occurrences that will be affected by the change.
            Review the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. </li>
            <li>Click Do Refactoring in the Refactoring window to apply the changes to the selected files.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
            any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
            node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.</li>
