        <h2>Extracting a Superclass</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

	    
        <p>When you extract a superclass, the IDE does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a new class with the selected methods and fields in the selected class.
            You can also have the new class implement interfaces that are implemented in the selected class.
            <p>If the selected class extends a class, the new class also extends the same class.</p></li>
            <li>The selected class is modified so that it extends the new superclass. All selected interfaces are removed from the <tt>implements</tt> clause.</li>
            <li>Removes the selected <tt>public</tt> and <tt>protected</tt> fields from the base class.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can preview the files that will be changed  by clicking Preview in the Extract Interface dialog box.
            If Preview is clicked, a list of the files to be modified is displayed in the Refactoring window.
            If you do not want certain occurrences to be changed, you can clear the checkbox for that occurrence in the Refactoring window.
            Double-clicking on an occurrence opens that file in the Source editor, and the caret is placed in the line containing the occurrence.</li>
        </ul>   
	
        <p><b>To extract a superclass:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the class containing the methods or fields you want to move to the new superclass.</li>
            <li>In the Source editor, right-click in the file and choose Refactor &gt; Extract Superclass. 
            <p>The Extract Superclass dialog box opens.</p></li>
            <li>Type the name for your new superclass in the Superclass Name text field.</li>
            <li>Select the members you want to extract to the new superclass.</li>
            <li>(Optional) If you want to make a method abstract, select the Make Abstract checkbox for the method. 
            If you select this checkbox, the method will be declared in the superclass as an abstract method and overridden in the current class. 
            The method will be assigned the <tt>protected</tt> access modifier.</li>
        <li>If you click Refactor, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps. If you click Preview,
    the Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. If the 
    class that you are pushing members from has multiple subclasses and you do not 
    want the members to be pushed to all of them, be sure to clear the checkboxes 
    for the corresponding subclasses. Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>  
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
            any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
            node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.</li>
        </ul>
