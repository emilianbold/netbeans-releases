        <h2>Aligning Components</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Once you have added components, you can adjust their alignment 
        them to ensure that your form will appear as desired at runtime. 
     
        <p><b>To align components:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the components you want to align in the GUI Builder's workspace. </li>
            <li>Click the appropriate align button in the GUI Builder toolbar. Alternately, you 
                can right-click either component and choose Align > Left in Column 
                (or Align > Right in Column) from the pop-up menu.
                <p>The IDE shifts the component positions such that the specified edges are aligned 
                and the component anchoring relationships are updated.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>To align component baselines:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Selectthe component you want to align in the GUI Builder's workspace.</li>
            <li>Drag the component to the right or left of the component you want to align it with.</li>
            <li>When the horizontal guideline appears indicating that the first component's baseline is aligned with 
            the baseline of the second component and the spacing between the two components is 
            suggested with a vertical guideline, click to position the component.</li>
            <p>The IDE snaps the second component into a position aligned with the baseline of the first. 
            Status lines are displayed indicating the component spacing and 
            anchoring relationships. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>To indent components:</b> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the component you want to indent in the GUI Builder workspace.
            <li>Select the component below the component below which you want to indent it. 
            <li>When guidelines appear indicating that the first component's left edge is 
            aligned with that of the JLabel, move it further to the right until secondary 
            indentation guidelines appear. 
            <li>Click to position the component.</li>
            <p> The IDE indents the second component below the first component. </p>
        </ol>
