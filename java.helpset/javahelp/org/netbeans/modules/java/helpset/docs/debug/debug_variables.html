<h2>Viewing Variables and Expressions When Debugging</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>In the IDE, local variables are
listed in the Local Variables window, however it is also possible to evaluate
variables directly in the Source Editor.</p>
<p>You can view the values returned by each method call in an expression 
    by <a href="debug_expressionstep.html">stepping through an expression</a>.</p>

<h3>Using the Local Variables Window </h3>
<p>For each variable within the current call the Local Variables window displays
information including the variable name, type, and value. The Local Variables
window also displays all of the static fields from the present class and all
superclasses for each variable, as well as all of the inherited fields from all superclasses. </p>

<p>You can change the value of a local variable directly in the Local Variables 
window and then continue running your program with the new value in place. </p>
<!--<ul class="note"> <li>You can see values of local variables only if the class is compiled with the 
  <tt>-g</tt> option. To verify this setting, open <tt>nbproject/project.properties</tt> 
  in your project folder and check that <tt>javac.debug</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>.</ul>-->
  
<p> In some cases, the debugger assigns a pound sign (#) and a number as 
  the variable's value. This number is an unique identifier of the given instance. 
  You can use this identifier to determine if a variable points to the same instance 
  or to a different instance. You cannot edit this value.</p>
  
  <h3>Evaluating Variables in the Source Editor</h3>
<p> You can also evaluate a variable directly in the Source Editor by moving the 
  insertion point over the variable. If the variable is active in the current context, 
  the value of the variable is displayed in a tool tip. In cases where a program 
  includes different variables with the same name, the Source Editor displays 
  the value based on the current context, and not on the instance of the variable 
  in the source code.</p>

  <ul class="note"> 
    <li>You can track the changes in the value of a 
      variable during program execution by setting a watch on the variable. When 
      you create a watch, the value of the variable is immediately evaluated and 
      displayed in the Watches window. </li>
  </ul>
