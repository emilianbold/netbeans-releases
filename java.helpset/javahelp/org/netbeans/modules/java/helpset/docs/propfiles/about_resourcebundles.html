<h2>About Resource Bundles</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small> 
<p> Resource bundles store selected characteristics of an object as key and value
  pairs in a set of <tt>.properties</tt> files. You can store a variety of characteristics
  in resource bundles, like localized strings used to internationalize your code
  or properties for an Ant script. The IDE displays resource bundles as properties
  object nodes (<img src="./images/propertiesObject.gif" alt="Properties Object Node">)
  that contain nodes for each of its locales (<img src="./images/propertiesLocale.gif" alt="Properties locale node icon">)
  and keys (<img src="./images/propertiesKey.gif" alt="Properties key node icon">).
  <!--PENDING : this info would be helpful in the Internationalization section-->
</p>
<h3>Editing Resource Bundles</h3>
<p>The IDE enables you to manage an object's properties that are stored  in resource
	bundles. </p>
<p>There are two primary ways of editing the properties files stored in resource
	bundles in the IDE.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>In the Source Editor.</b> You can edit properties files in the Source
		Editor as standard text files. Initially, the default locale opens in the
		enabling you to edit existing keys and their values. 
	<li><b>In the Properties Editor.</b> You can edit the key and value pairs for
			all locales of a resource bundle in table layout. You can also add a new property
			to all of the locales in your resource bundle. 
</ul>
<ul class="note">
	<li>You can also manage a resource bundle's contents through the pop-up
		menu available on its Files window nodes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resource Bundles and Internationalization</h3>
<p>When used for internationalizing source code, the IDE stores each locale's
	characteristics in a<tt> .properties</tt> file which is contained within the
	resource bundle. Each key corresponds to the name of a property and
	must be the same for each locale. The key value is the localized string displayed
	by the object at runtime and can vary for each locale.
<ul class="note">
		<li>Though  resource bundles and locales are both <tt>.properties</tt> files, the
			IDE displays   
   resource bundles and the locales they contain using different icons
 in the Files window to avoid confusion.
</ul>
<p>The IDE also enables you to automate the process of internationalizing your
	source code. You can use the IDE's internationalization features to:
<ul>
	<li>Automatically replace hard-coded strings with internationalized ones</li>
	<li>Insert new internationalized strings as you write code</li>
	<li>Check your resource bundles to ensure they contain all of the necessary
		keys</li>
</ul>
