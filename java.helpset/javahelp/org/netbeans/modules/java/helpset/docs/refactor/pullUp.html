    <h2>Moving a Class Member to a Superclass</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    <p>You can use the Pull Up command to move methods and fields to a class that their 
    current class inherits from.</p>
    <p><b>To initiate the Pull Up operation:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Source Editor or Projects window, select the class that contains members 
        that you want to move.</li>
        <li>Choose Refactor &gt; Pull Up.
        <p>The Pull Up dialog box appears and displays a list of the class's members and 
        any interfaces that the class implements.</li>
        <li>In the Destination Supertype drop-down list, select the class that you want to move the 
        members to.</li>
        <li>Select the checkbox for the member or members that you want to move.
        <p>If the current class implements any interfaces, there are checkboxes 
        for these interfaces. If you select a checkbox for an interface, the <tt>implements</tt> 
        statement for that interface is moved to the superclass.</p></li>
        <li>(Optional) If you want to make a method abstract, select the Make Abstract checkbox 
        for the method. If you select this checkbox, the method will be declared in the 
        superclass as an abstract method and overridden in the current class. The method 
        will be assigned the <tt>protected</tt> access modifier.</li>
        <li>(Optional) If you do not want to review the changes before they are made, 
        clear the Preview All Changes checkbox.</li>
        <li>Click Next. If you have cleared the Preview All Changes checkbox, the IDE applies 
        the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps.</li>
        <li>The Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
            the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. 
        </li>
        <li>(Optional) Double-click a file name in the Refactoring window to open the file, 
        or double-click a line of code to open the source file and to position the 
        cursor on that line of code.</li>
        <li>Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.
        </li>
    </ol>
