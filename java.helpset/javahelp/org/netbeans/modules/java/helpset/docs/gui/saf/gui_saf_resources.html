        <h2>About Resources in the Swing Application Framework</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        
<p>The Swing Application Framework simplifies the handling of resources in 
    applications and makes it possible for more things to be stored in resource bundles. 
</p>
<p>A typical Swing Application Framework application has resource bundles 
at both the application level and the class level. The class-level resource bundles have the same names as their 
corresponding <tt>.java</tt> classes except that they contain the <tt>.properties</tt> 
extension. All of these bundles are encapsulated by a <tt>ResourceMap</tt> object.</p>
<p>You can edit some standard application level resources (such as 
    application name) in the 
    Project Properties dialog box. Any application-level resources not 
    included in the Project Properties dialog box (such as resources that 
you define yourself)  can be edited in the 
    the <tt>.properties</tt> file that corresponds with the name of the main 
    application class.</p>
<p>You can open the Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and 
choosing Properties. Application properties appear in the Application panel 
and the Desktop Application panel.</p>
<p>When you start an application from the Java Desktop Application project template, 
by default your code is generated with the Swing Application Framework's conventions for 
managing resources, such as UI text. The values of component properties that you 
set are stored as resources as well.
</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul class="note">
    <li>If you do not want resources to be stored in <tt>.properties</tt> files 
        for a form, you can change the way the values are stored. Select the root form 
        node in the Inspector window. In the Properties window, select Off from 
        the Automatic Resource Management drop-down list.</li>
    <li>If you do not want the value for a specific property to be stored in 
        a <tt>.properties</tt> file, click the ellipsis (...) 
button next to the given property in the Properties window. Then clear the 
Define as Resource property.</li>

</ul>

API documentation. Choose
