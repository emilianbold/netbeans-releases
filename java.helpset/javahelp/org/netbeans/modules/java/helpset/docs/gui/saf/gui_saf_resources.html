        <h2>About Resources in the Swing Application Framework</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        
        <p>The Swing Application Framework simplifies the handling of resources in 
            applications and makes it possible for more things to be stored in resource bundles. 
        </p>
        <p>A typical Swing Application Framework application has resource bundles 
            at both the application level and the class level. The class-level resource bundles have the same names as their 
            corresponding <tt>.java</tt> classes except that they contain the <tt>.properties</tt> 
        extension. All of these bundles are encapsulated by a <tt>ResourceMap</tt> object.</p>
        <p>You can edit some standard application level resources (such as 
            application name) in the 
            Project Properties dialog box. Any application-level resources not 
            included in the Project Properties dialog box (such as resources that 
            you define yourself)  can be edited in the 
            the <tt>.properties</tt> file that corresponds with the name of the main 
        application class.</p>
        <p>You can open the Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and 
            choosing Properties. Application properties appear in the Application panel 
        and the Desktop Application panel.</p>
        <p>When you start an application from the Java Desktop Application project template, 
            by default your code is generated with the Swing Application Framework's conventions for 
            managing resources, such as UI text. The values of component properties that you 
            set are stored as resources as well.
        </p>
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can configure the way that code is generated to handle resources.
                Select the root form node in the Inspector window. In the Properties window, 
                select one of the following from 
                the Automatic Resource Management drop-down list.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Off</b>. All property values are hard-coded in the <tt>.java</tt> file.</li>
                    <li><b>Internationalization</b>. Resource code is generated for all 
                    strings, and the string values are stored in a <tt>.properties</tt> file.</li>
                    <li><b>All Resources</b>. Resource code is generated for all 
                    strings, colors, fonts, and icons. The values for these properties 
                are stored in a <tt>.properties</tt> file.</li>
                    <li><b>Resources + Injection</b>. Code is generated so that 
                    resource values are injected into the application from 
                <tt>.properties</tt> files at runtime.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>If you do not want the value for a specific property to be stored in 
                a <tt>.properties</tt> file, click the ellipsis (...) 
                button next to the given property in the Properties window. Then clear the 
            Define as Resource property.</li>
            
        </ul>
