        <h2>Managing Component Events</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p> The Java programming language uses events to enable GUI form behavior. Source
        objects can trigger events which one or more objects with event listeners react
        to by means of event handlers.</p>
        <h3>Defining Event Handlers</h3>
        <p> You can define event handlers using a component's property sheet or contextual
        menu. You can also define an event handler using the Connection wizard. </p>
        <p><b>To define an event handler using the property sheet:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Select the component in the Inspector window.</li>
            <li>Click the Events button at the top of the Properties window.</li>
            <li> Click the value of the desired event in the list. Initially, the value
            for all events is <tt>&lt;none&gt;</tt>. When you click the value field, <tt>&lt;none&gt;</tt> is
            automatically replaced with the default event name. </li>
            <li> Open the Handlers dialog box by clicking
            the event's ellipsis (...) button. </li>
            <li>Enter the event handler name by clicking the Add button to add a new name
            to the list of handlers. Click OK. <p>The code for the listener and the
            empty body of the handler method is generated. </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Note that you still must add the desired
            code for the new event handler in the Source Editor. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>To define an event handler using the contextual menu:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Right-click  a form component in the Files window, Project window, or
            Inspector window.</li>
            <li>Choose Events from the contextual menu and its submenus. Bold menu items
                in the Events submenus indicate event handlers that have already been defined.
                <p>The code for the listener and the empty body of the handler method is
                generated. The default name is assigned to the event handler.    
            </li>
            <li> Add your code for the new event handler in the Source Editor. </li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>If multiple events are of the same type, you can use the same
            handler for all of them. For example, you could set both <tt>focusGained</tt> and <tt>focusLost</tt> to
            use the <tt>button1FocusChange</tt> handler since they are
            both of the type <tt>java.awt.event.FocusEvent</tt>. You can also use the same handler
            for the same event on multiple components.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--
        <ul class="note">
        <li> You can set the style of how the code for
        component events and their handlers is generated. Choose Tools > Options.
        Expand the Editing node and select GUI Builder Settings. Set the Listener
        Generation Style property. You can choose between the Anonymous Innerclasses,
        One Innerclass, and Main Class styles. See <a href="gui_configuring.html">Configuring
        the GUI Builder</a> for a description of these options and other GUI Builder
        Settings. </li>
        </ul>-->

        <h3>Adding Multiple Handlers for One Event</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In the Inspector window, select the component for which  you want
            to add multiple handlers. </li>
            <li>Click the Events button at the top of the Properties window. </li>
            <li> Select the event in the property sheet and click the ellipsis (...) button
            to display the Handlers dialog box. Repeat these steps to add additional
            event handlers. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Removing Event Handlers</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> In the Inspector window, select the component whose event handler you
            want to remove.</li>
            <li>Click the Events button at the top of the Properties window. </li>
            <li> Select the event in
            the property sheet and click the ellipsis (...) button to display the Handlers
            dialog box. Alternately, you can simply delete the name of the handler  you
            want to remove in the Properties window. </li>
            <li> In  the Handlers dialog box, select the handler to remove
            from the  list and click Remove. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> When you remove an event handler, the corresponding code block is also deleted.
        If more than one handler uses the same name and same block of code, deleting
        a single reference to the code does not delete the code itself. Only deleting
        all references will delete the corresponding code block, and a confirmation
        dialog box is displayed first. </p>

        <!--<ul class="note">
            <li> If you remove an event but do not delete the
            event handler when prompted by the confirmation dialog box, an orphaned
            handler remains in the guarded text block. To delete the orphaned handler,
            you need to add another event handler of the same name, delete that event,
            and then agree to delete the handler in the confirmation dialog box. </li>
        </ul>-->
