        <h2>Encapsulate Fields Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Encapsulate Fields refactoring command.
        You can use the Encapsulate Fields command to create accessor methods for fields 
        in a class. With the Encapsulate Fields command, you can also have direct references 
        to those fields replaced with calls to the newly created accessor methods. 
        Accessor methods are also referred to as getters and setters or read/write 
        methods.</p>
       
        <p>You can open the Encapsulate Fields
        dialog box from the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. In one 
        of these windows, right-click a field (or a reference to the field elsewhere in 
        your code) and choose Refactor &gt; Encapsulate Fields.</p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>List of Fields to Encapsulate.</b> Contains a list of fields 
                in the class. Select the checkbox for each field that you want to 
                encapsulate.
            </li>
            <li><b>Fields' Visibility.</b> Drop-down list containing the four 
                possible accessibility modifiers (<tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, 
                <tt>&lt;default&gt;</tt>, and <tt>private</tt>). Select the accessibility 
                modifier that you want the field or fields to have.
            </li>
            <li><b>Accessor's Visibility.</b> Drop-down list containing the four 
                possible accessibility modifiers (<tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, 
                <tt>&lt;default&gt;</tt>, and <tt>private</tt>). Select the accessibility 
                modifier that you want the accessor (getter and setter) methods to have.
            </li>
            <li><b>Use Accessors Even When Field Is Accessible.</b> If selected, any 
                direct references in your code to the field are updated to use the accessor methods instead. 
                If not selected, any direct references to the fields that you already have in 
                your code are not replaced. 
                <p>This option only has an impact if both of the following are true:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have direct references to the field in your 
                    code.</li>
                    <li>You have set the field's accessor modifier so that the field is visible 
                    to the classes with these references.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you clear the Preview All Changes checkbox, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
