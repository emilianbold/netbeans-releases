<h2>Building a Java Project</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>
<p>When you build a project, the IDE calls the corresponding target in the project's
	Ant build script. The IDE compiles the source files and generates the packaged
	build output, such as a JAR file or WAR file. You can build a project 
        and all of its required projects, or build any 
  project individually.</p>
  
  <p>You do not need to build the project or compile individual classes to run the 
  project in the IDE. By default, the IDE automatically compiles classes when you 
save them. These incrementally compiled files are stored in a cache in your 
user directory and are copied to your project's <tt>build</tt> folder 
when you run or debug your project. This incremental compilation can save you 
a lot of time when you are editing and testing your project.</p>

<p>However, you need to build the project to generate distributable files 
for the project, such as JAR files.</p>

<p>By default, the Build Project command is not enabled since most of that command's 
functions are handled by the incremental compilation. However, you can use the 
Clean and Build command to create a fresh build. When you clean 
and build a project, all previous build outputs are deleted and new versions 
of the build outputs are created.</p>

<p><b>To build a project and its required projects:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the project that you want to build in the Projects window.</li>
    <li>Choose Run &gt; Clean and Build Project (Shift+F11).
        <p>Alternatively, right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Clean and Build.</p>
    <p>The IDE displays the Ant output and any compilation errors in the Output window.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>You can double-click any error to go to the location in the source code where the error occurred.
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
    <li>If you are building a project often you can set a project as the main project by right-clicking a project in the 
        Projects window and choosing Set as Main Project or by choosing Run &gt; Set Main Project 
        from the main menu and selecting the project in the sub-menu. 
        After you set a project as the main project the keyboard shortcuts for
        Run (F6), Build (F11) and Clean and Build (Shift+F11) will apply to the main project
        regardless of which project is selected in the Projects window.
        Keyboard shortcuts for Debug and Profile will also apply to the main project.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To stop building a project:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>Choose Run &gt; Stop Build/Run from the main menu.</li>
</ul>

        </object> that have a main class specified, the IDE automatically copies 
        any JAR files on the project's classpath to the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder 
        when you build the project. The IDE also adds each of the JAR files 
        to the Class-Path element in the application JAR's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
        file. This simplifies running the application outside the IDE. For more 
        information, see <a href="comp_jar_deploy.html">Preparing 
        a JAR for Deployment Outside the IDE</a></li>

<p><b>To turn off incremental compilation for a project:</b> 
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
  <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Compiling node and 
  clear the Compile On Save checkbox.</li>
