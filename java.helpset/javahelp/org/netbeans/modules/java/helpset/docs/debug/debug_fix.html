<h2>Fixing and Continuing</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> If you find a problem while debugging, you can use the Apply Code Changes 
command to fix your source and then continue debugging with the changed code without restarting your program.</p>

<p>It is not possible to use the Apply Code Changes command to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change a modifier of a field, a method, or a class</li>
<li>Add or remove methods or fields</li>
<li>Change the hierarchy of classes</li>
<li>Change classes that have not been loaded into the virtual machine</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To fix your code:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>From the main menu, choose Run &gt; Apply Code Changes
    to recompile and begin repairing your source code.
    <ul>
        <li>If there are errors during compilation, nothing is changed in your program. 
        Edit your source code as needed, then execute the Apply Code Changes command 
        again.</li> 
        <li>If there are no errors, the resulting object code is swapped into the currently
            executing program. However, all calls on the call stack continue running
            the unfixed code. To use the modified code, you must pop from the call
            stack any calls that contain modified code. When the calls are reentered,
            they use the modified code. 

            <p><b>Note:</b> If you  modify the currently running method, the IDE displays
                an alert box. If you click the Pop Call button, the most recent call is
                removed from the current call stack. If you click the Leave Call button,
                the program executes with the original version of the code. If there is only
        one call in the stack, you cannot pop the call and continue.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Continue the program to verify that the fixed version of your code works correctly.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
    <li> The Apply Code Changes command does not automatically rebuild 
      JAR files, executable files, or similar files. You must rebuild these files 
      if you want to debug them in a new session. 
      <!--check that JAR does not get rebuilt when you fix and continue -->
    </li> 
</ul>
