        <h2>Move Class Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use the Move Class dialog box to specify where to move classes 
        and to specify whether other code is updated to reflect the new location of the class. 
        The Move Class dialog box appears after you have done one of the following actions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Chosen the Refactor &gt; Move refactoring command.</li>
            <li>Cut and pasted Java files in the Projects window or in the Files window.
            </li>
            <li>Dragged and dropped files in the Projects window or in the Files window.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project.</b> The name of the project to which you are moving the classes.
            </li>
            <li><b>Location.</b> The part of the project to which you are moving the classes. 
                The appropriate value here is generally Source Packages, but it is also 
                possible to have other source roots represented in this field.
            </li>
            <li><b>To Package.</b> The package to which you are moving the classes. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want the class to be moved immediately, click Refactor.</p>
        <p>If you want to preview the change first, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Preview. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
