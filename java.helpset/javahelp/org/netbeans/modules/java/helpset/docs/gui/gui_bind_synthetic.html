       Special Binding Properties (Java Desktop Applications)
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>Where necessary, the beans binding library provides special synthetic 
    properties for some Swing components that are missing from the components 
    themselves. These properties represent things, such as a table's selected row, 
    that are useful to bind to other properties.</p>
    
    <p>Below is a list of the synthetic properties added by the beans binding libraries:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists the
   component. The middle column lists properties available for the
   component in the left column. The right column provides a description of the property.">
        <tr align="left" valign="top">

            <th scope="col">Component</th>
            <th scope="col">Property</th>
            <th scope="col">Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tbody>

                <td>selected</td>

            </tr>

                <td>value</td>

                    If there is a JListBinding with the JList as the target,
                    the selected element is reported as an element from the
                    binding's source list. Otherwise, the selected element is
                    reported as an object from the list's model. If nothing is
                selected, the property evaluates to <tt>null</tt>. </td>

                    column index and the values are the model values for that
                    column. Example:
