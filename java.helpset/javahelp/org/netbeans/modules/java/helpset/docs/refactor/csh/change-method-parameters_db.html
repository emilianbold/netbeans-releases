        <h2>Change Method Parameters Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Change Method Parameters refactoring command.
        You can use the Change Method Parameters command to alter the signature of a 
        method and have those changes propagated in all of the code that calls this method. 
        Specifically, you can:</p>
        <ul><li>Add parameters to a method.</li>
            <li>Reorder the parameters in a method signature.</li>
            <li>Change the access modifier for the method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can open the Change Method Parameters 
        dialog box from the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. In one 
        of these windows, right-click a field and choose Refactor &gt; Change Method Parameters.</p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Parameters.</b> Table that contains a list of parameters for the 
                method. Use the Add, Move Up, and Move Down buttons 
                to add and rearrange the order of parameters.</p> 
                <p>Use the Remove button to remove any parameters that you have added 
                in the dialog box but that you do not want to keep. 
                You can not remove parameters that were in the method 
                before you opened the dialog box.</p>
                <p>The Parameters table has columns for the method name, 
                type, and default value. Double-click in a cell to edit a value. </p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Access Modifier.</b>  Drop-down list containing the four 
                possible accessibility modifiers (<tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, 
                <tt>&lt;default&gt;</tt>, and <tt>private</tt>). Select the accessibility 
                modifier that you want the method to have.
            </li>
            <li><b>Method Signature Preview.</b> Read-only field that displays 
                what the method signature will look like if you apply the changes 
                that you have specified in the dialog box.
            </li>
            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you clear the Preview All Changes checkbox, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
