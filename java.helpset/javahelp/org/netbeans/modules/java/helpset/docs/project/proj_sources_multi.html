<h2>Multiple Source Roots in Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>You can add multiple sources roots to either standard or free-form projects
	that  require them. However,
	you should never add the same source root to more than one project because
	this is not supported in the IDE. 
<h3>Standard Projects</h3>
<p>In Standard projects,  it is sometimes advantageous to add  additional
	source roots to your project's classpath such as, for example,  when the project
	uses sources stored in a separate resources folder. Because all source directories
	on a standard project's classpath form a single compilation unit, they are
also	packaged into the application's JAR when the project is built. In Standard
	projects, you add source roots to the classpath using the project wizard and
	properties dialog.
<ul class="note">
	<li>Source roots must only   exist in a single project  and
		cannot be shared with other projects, regardless of whether they are opened
		or not. If you need to use a library in several projects, create a special
		project within which to store it.
</ul>

<h3>Free-Form Projects</h3>
<p>In free-form projects, each source root can be assigned to independent compilation
	units providing you maximum flexibility when structuring your applications.
	Free-form projects, however, require that you manage the classpath by editing
	your build.xml file directly. For more information, see Managing the Classpath.

</ul>
<h3>Using Libraries in Multiple Projects</h3>
<p>If you want to add a library to more than
	one project, you must create a special project within which store the
	 library's compiled source that you want to use.
