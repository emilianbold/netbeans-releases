        <h2>Pull Up Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Pull Up refactoring command.
        You can use the Pull Up command to move one or more members from 
        the selected class to a superclass. </p>
       
        <p>You can open the Pull Up dialog box by choosing Refactor &gt; Pull Up  
            after you have selected a class in the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Destination Supertype.</b> Drop-down list that contains the names of the superclasses for the 
current class. Select the class that you want to move class members to.
            </li>
           <li><b>Members to Pull Up.</b> Contains the list of inner classes, methods, and fields in 
                the current class. 
                <p>Select the checkbox to the left of each member that you want to have 
                moved to the selected superclass.</p>
                <p>Select the Make Abstract checkbox for any methods that you have selected to 
                pull up for which you would like to have the declaration in the superclass but keep the 
                implementation in the current class. </p>
            </li>

        </ul>

      <p>If you want to preview the changes, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Preview. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
