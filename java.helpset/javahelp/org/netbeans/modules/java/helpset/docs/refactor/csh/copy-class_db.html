        <h2>Copy Class Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use the Copy Class dialog box to specify where to copy classes 
        and to specify whether other code is updated to reflect the new location of the class. 
        The Copy Class dialog box appears after you have done one of the following actions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Chosen the Refactor &gt; Copy Classes refactoring command.</li>
            <li>Cut and pasted Java files in the Projects window or in the Files window.
            </li>
            <li>Dragged and dropped files in the Projects window or in the Files window.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project.</b> The name of the project to which you are moving the classes.
            </li>
            <li><b>Location.</b> The part of the project to which you are moving the classes. 
                The appropriate value here is generally Source Packages, but it is also 
                possible to have other source roots represented in this field.
            </li>
            <li><b>To Package.</b> The package to which you are moving the classes. 
            </li>
            <li><b>List of Classes.</b> Displays the 
            name of the copied classes. This field is not displayed if only one 
            class is being copied.</li>
            <li><b>Copy Without Refactoring.</b> If selected, no code is changed 
            to correspond with the file's new location. This option appears when you have 
            manually copied a class.</li>

            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the package rename 
                or moving of classes is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not want the class to be copied, click Cancel.</p>
        <p>If you want to proceed with the refactoring, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
