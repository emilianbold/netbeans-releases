LBL_ErrorStoppingServer=The IDE could not stop the Sun Java System Application Server.\n
LBL_ErrorStartingServer=The Sun Java System Application Server could not start.\nMore information about the cause is in the Server log file.\nPossible reasons include:\n - IDE timeout: refresh the server node to see if it's running now.\n - Port conflicts. (use netstat -a to detect possible port numbers already used by the operating system.) \n - Incorrect server configuration (domain.xml to be corrected manually) \n - Corrupted Deployed Applications preventing the server to start.(This can be seen in the server.log file. In this case, domain.xml needs to be modified).\n - Invalid installation location.
LBL_ErrorStartingProfiledServer=Could not rewrite the server''s configuration file to use selected JDK.\nRestart the IDE with --jdkhome {0}
LBL_ErrorProfiledServer=Server is already started via the profiler. Use the Attach Profiler item of the Profile menu to continue.
