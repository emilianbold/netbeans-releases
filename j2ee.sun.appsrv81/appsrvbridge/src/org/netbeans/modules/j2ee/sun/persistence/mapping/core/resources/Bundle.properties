ACSD_page1=\
    This wizard allows you to set up or edit the database mapping for a Java class. \
    When you are finished, you will have a persistence-capable class that is mapped \
    to one or more database tables.\n\n

# The value from ACSD_page1 from above will be the prefix of this in 
# the text area in the first page of the mapping wizard.
MSG_page1=\
    Before you begin, make sure that:\n\n\
    - The database schema to which you want to map this class is captured \
    into a filesystem in the Explorer window. To capture a schema, choose New... \
    from the File menu and then select Database Schema from the Databases folder.\n\n \
    - Any Java classes that have relationships to the class you are mapping are \
    persistence-capable. Otherwise you will not be able to set up the mapping for those \
    relationship fields\n\n\
    - All fields in this class that you intend to be persistent are marked as persistent. To \
    make a field persistent, view that field's properties and change the Persistent property to True.\n\n\
    If your class is ready for mapping, click the Next button.

MSG_page2=\
Use the Browse... button to select the primary table (from a currently mounted database \
schema) to which you want to map your class. Then, if you want to map additional \
tables to this class, click the Add... button to add a secondary table.

MSG_FieldMap=Note: Selecting multiple columns implies that all columns will have the same value as the field.

MSG_page3=Use the drop-down menu for each field to map it to a database column. \
To map a field to more than one column, or to map a relationship field, use the ... button. \
If you want to map a field to a column in a table that is not in the \
drop-down list, return to the previous screen and add a secondary table to the mapping.

# Related Class Panel
RMW_Initial_Step_Text=Indicate which persistence-capable class this \
relationship field points to by selecting a related class. If you \
want this to be a managed relationship (optional), choose the \
related field in the related class that should point back at this field. \
If the related class is not mapped yet, select the primary table to \
which it should be mapped.

RMW_Relationship_Navigation_Text=Indicate how this relationship \
will be navigated in the database:
RMW_Link_Directly= Link the Mapped Tables Directly (typically 1..1 or 1..n relationship).
RMW_Mnemonic_Link_Directly=L
RMW_Link_Using_Join= Link the Mapped Tables Using a Join Table (typically n..m relationship).
RMW_Mnemonic_Link_Using_Join=J
HINT_relatedPrimaryTable=Table to which the related class is mapped

# Map to Key Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Top_Text=Map the relationship field to a key, \
described as a pair or pairs of columns.  The most common \
way to map a relationship field is to map it to a \
foreign key or the inverse of a foreign key.  If there \
is no foreign key defined, you might want to map to a \
reference key or define a custom key.
RMW_Map_To_Key_Bottom_Text=Review the default key or \
define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs \
of columns from the tables mapped to this class and \
the related class.  The columns in each pair are \
expected to have the same value.  To create a compound \
key, use the Add Pair button.

# Map to Key: Local to Join Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Local_To_Join_Top_Text=Choose a join table.  Then, \
map the relationship field to a key, described as a \
pair or pairs of columns.  The most common way to map \
a relationship field is to map it to a foreign key \
or the inverse of a foreign key.  If there is no foreign \
key defined, you might want to map to a reference key \
or define a custom key.
RMW_Join_Table=Join Table:
RMW_Mnemonic_Join_Table=J
RMW_Map_To_Key_Local_To_Join_Bottom_Text=Review the default \
key or define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs of \
columns from the tables mapped to this class. \
The columns in each pair are expected to have the same value. \
To create a compound key, use the Add Pair button.

# Map to Key: Join to Foreign Panel
RMW_Map_To_Key_Join_To_Foreign_Top_Text=Map the relationship field \
to a key, described as a pair or pairs of columns.  The most \
common way to map a relationship field is to map it to \
a foreign key or the inverse of a foreign key.  If there \
is no foreign key defined, you might want to map to a \
reference key or define a custom key.
RMW_Map_To_Key_Join_To_Foreign_Bottom_Text=Review the default \
key or define your own custom key.  A key contains pairs \
of columns from the join table and columns from tables mapped to \
this class.  The columns in each pair are expected to have the \
same value.  To create a compound key, use the Add Pair button.
