    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>In the Services window, each registered instance of the GlassFish application server is represented by a node under
    the Servers node in the Services window. The subnodes of the GlassFish instance node
    represent the resources and applications that have been deployed to the server.</p>
    <p>The following table shows you how to use the nodes in the Services window to explore and work with the server instance.
    To delete a resource, locate and right-click the resource under the appropriate node and choose Delete Resource.</p>
    
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column contains the graphic icon for server instance nodes in the Services window.
