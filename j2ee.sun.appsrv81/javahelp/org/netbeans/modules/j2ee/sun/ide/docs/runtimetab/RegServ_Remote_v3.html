        <p>Use this page to specify the details of the local or remote domain by selecting one of the following options.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Register Local Domain.</strong>
                <p>Choose an existing domain from the dropdown list or create a new domain by typing the domain name in the text field.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Register Remote Domain.</strong>
            <p>Enter the following information for the remote domain:</p>

        <!--<p>Click Next if you want to supply a username and password for the remote domain.
