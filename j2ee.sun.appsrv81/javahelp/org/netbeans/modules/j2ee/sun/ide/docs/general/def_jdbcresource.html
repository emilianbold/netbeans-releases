    <h2>Setting up a JDBC Resource on the GlassFish Application Server</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>A JDBC resource (data source) provides applications with a means of connecting
    to a database through a connection pool. Typically, there is at least one JDBC
    resource for each database accessed by an application deployed in a
    domain. It is possible to have more than one JDBC resource for a
    database.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>A JDBC resource connects to a JDBC connection pool. If you have not already
        created the JDBC connection pool, you can create it in the wizard while you are creating the
        resource.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.platform/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/platform/docs/ejb/editing/generate_cmp_beans.html">generate CMP entity beans from a database</a> 
    or use the Enterprise Resources &gt; Use Database command 
    to generate lookup code for a database, the JDBC data sources are generated automatically.</p>
    <p><b>To create a JDBC resource:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the GlassFish application server is running.</li>
        <li>Go to File &gt; New (Ctrl-N).</li>
        <li>In the Project drop-down list, choose either your EJB module or Web module.</li>
        <li>Select GlassFish in the Categories pane, JDBC Resource in the File Types pane, and click Next.</li>
        <li>Select an existing connection pool or create a new one.</li>
        <li>(required) Enter a JNDI name for the resource.</li>
        <li>Enable or disable the resource by choosing True or False.</li>
        <li>Enter a description and click Next.</li>
        <li>Enter any properties for the resource.</li>
        <li>Click Finish.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><b>To prepare to use a data source:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the GlassFish application server is running.</li>
        <li>Create a web application and select the GlassFish Application Server as the target server.</li>
        <li>Access the data source in, for example, a <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.tomcat5/org/netbeans/modules/tomcat5/docs/tomcat/tomcat_use_tdcp.html">JSP page</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The resource is automatically registered when the project is deployed. 
    When you register the resource, the resource is available to all applications and resources.</p>
