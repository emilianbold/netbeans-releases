        <h2>Registering a Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish Instance</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>To begin developing enterprise applications you must first register an instance of the
        Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish with the IDE.</p>

        <p>If you deploy your applications to a remote instance of the
        Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, those libraries are available at runtime. However, during 
        development, to compile your project you need a local instance of this server and libraries.</p>
        <p>You can have multiple instances of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish registered with the 
        IDE, but you must first specify the local folder that contains the local installation of 
        the server. You only need to specify the location of the local installation once.</p>
    
        <p><b>To register an instance of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Servers.</li>
            <li>In the Servers dialog box, click Add Server to open the Add Server wizard.
            <ul class="note">
                <li>Alternatively, right-click the Servers node in the Services window and choose 
                Add Server. </li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Select the server you want to register.</li>
            <li>Type a name for the server instance. This name is used to identify the server in the IDE.</li>
            <li>Click Next.</li>
            <li>Supply the platform location of the server.</li>
            <li>Select the type of domain you are registering.
                <ul class="note">
                <li>If you are registering the local default domain, the available domains are listed in the drop-down list.
                If you are registering a remote domain, you need to specify the host and port used to communicate with the remote domain.
                </li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Click Finish to complete the Add Server Instance wizard. 
            Alternatively, click Next if you want to enter a username and password for the domain.</li>
            <ul class="note">
                <li>If you do not enter a username and password when you register the server instance, 
                you are prompted to supply the username and password when needed.<br>
                The default username/password is admin/adminadmin.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click Close in the Servers dialog box.</li>
        </ol>  
        <p>Once a server instance is registered with the IDE, a node for the server instance is visible in the Services
        window under the Servers node. 
        You can perform the following tasks by right-clicking 
        the server instance node and choosing a task from the pop-up menu:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Start and stop a local server instance</li>
            <li>Remove an instance of the server</li> 
            <li>Open the Sun Java System Application Server admin console in a browser</li> 
            <li>View the server log file</li> 
            <li>View the properties of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To remove an instance of the Java System Application Server/GlassFish:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Servers.</li>
            <li>In the Servers dialog box, select the server name in the left pane.</li>
            <li>Click Remove.</li>
            <li>Click Close.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>
                Alternatively, in the Services window right-click the server instance you want to remove and 
                choose Remove from the pop-up menu.
            </li>
