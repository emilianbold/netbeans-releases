    <h2>Undeploying an Application or Module from the SJS Application Server</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>When the SJS Application Server is running, you can undeploy, enable, and disable an application 
    or module in the Runtime window of the IDE.
    By default, applications and modules are automatically registered, deployed and made available on the
    Application Server when you run a project, and are automatically redeployed when they have been modified in the IDE.</p>    
    <p>Deployed applications are visible in the Runtime window in the server instance node under
    Enterprise Applications or Web Applications. Deployed EJB Modules are visible in the EJB Modules node.
    When you undeploy an application or module, the archive file (<tt>ear</tt>, <tt>war</tt>, <tt>jar</tt>) 
    is removed from the server and is no longer visible in the Runtime window.</p>
    <p><b>To undeploy an application or module:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the Application Server is running.</li>
        <li>In the Runtime window, expand the Sun Java System Application Server instance 
        and the node containing the application or module.</li>
        <li>Right-click the application or module and choose Undeploy from the contextual menu.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The following options are also available as contextual menu items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Disable.</b> Disabling the application makes the archive file unavailable but it remains on the server. 
        In order to use the application you need to enable it.</li>
        <li><b>Enable.</b> Enabling an application that has been disabled makes the application available.</li>
        <li><b>Properties.</b> Choosing properties opens the properties window.
        Some of the properties can be modified through the properties window.</li>
    </ul>
