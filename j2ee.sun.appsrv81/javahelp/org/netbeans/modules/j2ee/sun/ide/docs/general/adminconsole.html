    <h2>Accessing the GlassFish Admin Console</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The instance node for the GlassFish application server in the IDE Services window provides a subset of the functions
    found in the GlassFish Admin Console. You can manage server
    resources through the instance node in the IDE or by using the GlassFish Admin Console.</p>
    
    <p><b>To access the GlassFish Admin Console:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the GlassFish application server is running. (Denoted by the running badge (&nbsp;<img src="../images/main-project-badge.gif">&nbsp;) next to the server's node in the Services window.)</li>
        <li>Right-click the server instance node and choose View Admin Console.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The login screen for the Admin Console launches in your browser. 
    After you log in, you can see that the options on the left
    are similar to those in the Services window in the IDE.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>To access the Admin Console, you are required to log in as the server administrator.
        The default username is <tt>admin</tt>. Unless the password has been changed, the default
        password is <tt>adminadmin</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you manage resources directly through the Admin Console, the resources are not directly associated with your project.</p>
