    <h2>Accessing the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish Admin Console</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The instance node for the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish in the IDE Services window provides a subset of the functions
    found in the Admin Console of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish. You can manage server
    resources through the instance node in the IDE or by using the Sun Java System Application Server Admin Console.</p>
    
    <p><b>To access the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish Admin Console:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish is running. (Denoted by the running badge (&nbsp;<img src="../images/main-project-badge.gif">&nbsp;) next to the Sun Java System Application Server node in the Runtime window.)</li>
        <li>Right-click the server instance node and choose View Admin Console.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The login screen for the Admin Console launches in your browser. 
    After you log in, you can see that the options on the left
    are similar to those in the Services window in the IDE.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>To access the Admin Console, you are required to log in as the server administrator.
        The default username is <tt>admin</tt>. Unless the password has been changed, the default
        password is <tt>adminadmin</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you manage resources directly through the Admin Console, the resources are not directly associated with your project.</p>
