        <h2>Add Server Instance Wizard: Server Location</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You see this page of the Add Server Instance wizard when you specify domain details to register an instance of the GlassFish application server or Sun Java System Application Server with the IDE.
        To register a server instance, you specify the properties of a local or remote domain.</p>
        <p>Use this page to specify the following information about the location of the GlassFish application server or Sun Java System Application Server and the type of domain you are registering.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server Location.</b> Supply the path to the local installation of the GlassFish application server or Sun Java System Application Server.
            Click Browse to navigate to the location.</li>
            <li><b>Type of domain.</b> Select the type of domain to register.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Register Local Default Domain.</b> Select this type to register a domain located in the default domain folder of the platform you specify.
                    <p>Choose a domain from the list of accessible domains found in the default domain folder.</p>
                    <ul class="note"><li>When you install the server, the default domain folder containing a default domain is created in the local installation folder.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Register Local Domain.</b> Select this type to register a local domain located outside the default domain folder of the platform you specify.
                    If you select this type, you need to specify the location of the local domain.</li>
                    <li><b>Register Remote Domain.</b> Select this type to register a remote domain. 
                    If you select this type, you need to supply the host and communication port for the remote domain.
                    <ul class="note"><li>You cannot stop or start a remote server from within the IDE.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><b>Create Personal Domain.</b>
                    Select this type to create a new domain.
                    This option is only available if you are registering an instance of the GlassFish application server or Sun Java System Application Server.
                    If you select this type, you need to specify where to create the new domain. 
                    Choosing this type enables you to specify port settings for the new domain.
                    You can also choose a profile type from the drop-down list.</li>
                    <li><b>Profile.</b>
                    If you are registering an instance of the Sun Java System Application Server 9.1.x/GlassFish v2.x,
                    when you create a personal domain you can choose a Profile type from the drop-down list.
                    If you are registering an earlier version of the application server, only the Default profile is available. 
                    <p>You choose a profile type according to how you intend to use the application server software.
                    The personal domain is created and configured based on the profile that you choose. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Default.</b> This domain is essentially the same as the Developer profile.</li>
                        <li><b>Developer.</b> This domain is configured to be run in a development environment. 
                        This configuration offers the advantage of faster server startup.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster.</b> The domain is configured so that it can be used as part of a cluster of application server instances. </li>
                        <li><b>Enterprise.</b> The domain is configured to be used in a production environment for large-scale deployments. 
                        This profile offers greater security. This option requires that you have HADB installed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"><li>When you register an existing domain, the IDE uses the port numbers and other properties specified in the domain configuration.</li></ul>
        
        <!--
        <p>When registering an instance of the Sun Java System Application Server, you need to supply the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Location (host:port).</b> (required) This is the host name or IP and the admin port. 
            You can register your local instance by selecting the instance from the combo box (default host and port is localhost:4848),
            or a remote instance by entering the
            IP address and port number. When registering an instance,
            the port must not be in use by another service or application. </li>
            <li><b>Domains Folder.</b> This is the location of the local domains directory. 
                Specify an existing domains directory location or the location for creating a new domain. This field is dimmed if the 
                IDE has already determined the domains directory of the local domain instance.
                <ul class="note"><li>If you are registering a remote instance, the domains folder location is not required.</li></ul>
            </li>            
            <li><b>Instance Name.</b> (optional) This is the name of the local domain instance. Enter the domain name if you are
            creating a new domain instance. This field is dimmed if the 
            IDE has already determined the name of the local domain instance.</li>            
            <li><b>Username.</b> (optional) This is the admin user name for the server.</li>
            <li><b>Password.</b> (optional) This is the admin password.
            <ul class="note">
                <li>If you do not enter a username and password, you will be prompted for the admin username and password when the server is started.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When creating a new local instance, the IDE automatically assigns a port number to the instance. </li>
            <li>When registering a local instance of the server, the IDE attempts to determine the domains folder. 
            When determining the location of the domains directory, one of the following occurs:
            <ul>
                <li>The IDE is able to locate accessible server instances in the default Domains folder, 
                and these instances appear in the Location combo box. In this case the Domains Folder location 
                and Instance Name are dimmed.</li>
                <li>The IDE is unable to locate accessible server instances in the default Domains folder. In this case you must 
                specify an existing, accessible Domains Folder location and Instance Name (if no server instances are available at that location), 
                or create a new server instance by specifying an accessible Domains Folder and an Instance Name for the new server instance. </li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
