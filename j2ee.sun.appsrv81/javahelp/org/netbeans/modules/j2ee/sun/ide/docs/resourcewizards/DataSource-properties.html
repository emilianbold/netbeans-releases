    <h2>JDBC Resource Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pool-name.</b> The name of the connection pool the data source will use.</li>
        <li><b>JNDI name.</b> The JNDI name must be unique to this JDBC resource.
        The JNDI name of a JDBC resource is expected in the <tt>java:comp/env/jdbc</tt> subcontext. 
        For example, the JNDI name for the resource of a payroll database could 
        be <tt>java:comp/env/jdbc/payrolldb</tt>. Because all resource JNDI names are in 
        the <tt>java:comp/env</tt> subcontext, when you specify the JNDI name of a JDBC 
        resource enter only jdbc/name. For example, for a payroll database, specify <tt>jdbc/payrolldb</tt>.</li>
        <li><b>Object-types.</b> The type of the object. A resource object may be
        user, system-all, system-admin, or system-instance.</li>
        <li><b>Enabled.</b> Set to true to enable the resource, or false to disable the resource.</li>
        <li><b>Description.</b> Description of the resource (optional).</li>
