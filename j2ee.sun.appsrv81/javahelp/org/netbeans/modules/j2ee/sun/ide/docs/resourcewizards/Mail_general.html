        <h2>JavaMail Session: General Attributes</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You see this page of the New File wizard when you are <a href="../general/def_javamail.html">defining a JavaMail Session resource</a>.
        On this page you specify general and advanced configuration information for a JavaMail Session resource
        and specify the JNDI name of the resource.</p> 
        
        <p>Use this page as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Supply the general information for the resource. 
            The following information is required and must be supplied before you can Finish or 
            proceed to the next screen:
            <ul>
                <li><b>JNDI Name.</b> The JNDI must be unique to the resource. JavaMail Session resources are usually placed withing the <tt>mail</tt> naming subcontext.</li>
                <li><b>Mail Host.</b> The host name is the DNS name of the default mail server. 
                The name must be resolvable to an actual host name.</li>
                <li><b>Default User.</b> Enter the user name to use when connecting to the mail server.</li>
                <li><b>Default Return Address.</b> Enter the email address of the default user, in the form <tt>username@host.domain</tt>.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Advanced information is optional. It is best to leave the advanced settings at their default values unless 
            the Application Server's mail provider has been reconfigured to 
            use a nondefault store or transport protocol.
            <ul class="note">
                <li>Setting Debug Enabled to True, enables extra debugging output. including 
                a protocol trace, for this mail session. If the JavaMail log level
                is set to FINE or finer, the debugging output is generated and is included 
                in the system log file. See "Configuring Log Levels" for 
                information about setting the log level.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Click Finish to create the resource.<br>
            Click Next to proceed to the advanced properties screen.</li>
        </ol>
       <p>When you complete the wizard, the resource properties are added to <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt>.
        If you need to edit the properties of the resource, you can open <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> in the Source Editor by expanding the 
        Server Resources node of your project in the Projects window and double-clicking the file. </p>
                
        <p>Once you have created the object in your project, the resource needs to be registered with the server before you can use it.
        The resource is automatically registered when you deploy your project.</p>
        <p>After the resource is registered, the resource appears in the JavaMail Sessions node under the Resources node for the server
        instance in the Services window.</p>
