Known issues
============

Unsorted
--------

- Add const where applicable
- replace strerorr with err_to_string
- when reporting error (say, in protocol) to stderr, respond error package to stdout, otherwise client will wait forever

High
----

- non-ASCII file names

- it seems access rights aren't passed properly. Check this.

fs_server[5036]: unexpected numeric value: '/home/src/netbeans/pythia-platform/
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

fs_server[23925]: error opening /home/.netbeans/remotefs/dirtab for writing: File exists

Medium
------

- refactor decode_decimal so it returns int and modifies pointer by reference,
otherwise we can get an issue with different types of stat structure on different platforms

- error processing: working with error messages on cline site

- stress test

- sync between refreshing and storing cache content

- atomic file writes (use tmp file and rename)

- 2-phase commit? what if
    - content changed
    - fs_server reported the change
    - fs_server was asked for new content, answered and logged the answer on disk
    - but IDE was shutting down at that moment, so it didn't process this

- the cache is flat, so tons of directories an downgrade performance

- 64-bit Linux issue

- check for leaks

- handshake 1-st message, version...

- when reading dir, consider simultaneous adding/removing files to this dir

- [client-side:] fs_server sends changes even for dirs that aren't instantiated in current IDE session at all.
That's correct. But the processing should be smarter on client side (now it will instantiate and refresh directory)

- what if two IDE instances are launched, one fs_server will fail to lock

- decode_int/long/uint return NULL, which isn't checked after all calls

- escape '\n' in file names

- support stat

Low
---

- ignore own storage? (disallow user surf the ~/.netbeans/remotefs)

- it would be fine to be able to quit accurately (process all request first)?

- consider anti-loop

- perform maximum checks on startup, report - allow client report and/or switch to a different implementation

- thorough error processing

- test error processing

- queue isn't effective in terms of memory: it uses alloc for each node...
possible solution for requests queue is cyclic buffer
(and in the case it is full, main() just waits

- dirtab uses malloc for each element, which is probably not effective enough

- support request cancellation

- don't communicate via lines, use packages - otherwise you'll get issue with '\n' in file name.

- write tests


Checks
------

- check for files closure

- check all malloc calls (abort if null?)

- check assertions and replace with more gentle checks?

- check that all mutexes are freed when exiting a function
