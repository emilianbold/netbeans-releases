     *     {@link #categoryLabel} should not be specified.
     *     The annotation must be placed on a class or factory method implementing {@link CompositeCategoryProvider}.
     * <li>Register a category folder with no panel.
     *     {@link #category} must be specified; the last path component is the
     *     folder being defined, and any previous components are parent folders.
     *     {@link #categoryLabel} must be specified.
     *     The annotation must be placed on some package declaration (in {@code package-info.java}).
     * <li>Register a category folder also with its own panel (i.e. {@code Self}).
     *     {@link #category} and {@link #categoryLabel} must be specified as for #2,
     *     but the annotation must be on a provider implementation as for #1.
     * </ol>
     * To represent hierarchies of panels, the {@link #category} of a #1 can
     * match the {@link #category} of a #2 or #3, and the {@link #category} of a #2 or #3
     * preceding the last {@code /} can match the {@link #category} of another #2 or #3.
     * <p>Multiple registrations may be made in one place using {@link Registrations}.
