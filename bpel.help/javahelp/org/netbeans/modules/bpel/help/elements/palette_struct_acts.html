<h2>BPEL Designer  Palette: Structured Activities </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Structured Activities section of the BPEL Designer
Palette contains icons for the following business process activities: Flow, Sequence, 
If, Pick, Scope,   While, Repeat Until, and For Each. These elements can group activities within a process in 
order to apply certain rules, or they can place certain restrictions on 
activities. The following table describes the activities you can add from the Palette to your business process diagram.</p>
