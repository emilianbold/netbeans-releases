<h2>BPEL Designer: Adding Termination Handlers </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The termination handler is used to control the termination of a running scope. The termination of a running scope happens if a scope or process enclosing it has faulted. </p>
<p>When a fault is thrown inside a scope or process, a fault handler associated with the scope or process should be run, but before that all the running activities inside the faulted  scope or process should be terminated. If a faulted scope or process has any enclosed scopes which are still running, they also should be terminated. Terminating a scope means terminating activities inside it and executing the termination handler associated with the scope.</p>
<p>Note that a scope can be terminated only if, it is either running normally, is running its compensation handler or termination handler. A completed scope as well as a scope that is faulted or is running its fault handlers cannot be terminated.</p>
<p>The termination handler is a container for the activities that will be performed in case a scope is terminated. You can add one termination handler for a  scope. </p>
<p>If a fault occurs inside the termination handler of a scope, the fault is not propagated to the enclosing scope.</p>
<p><b>To add a Termination Handler  to Scope or Process elements:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Design view right-click the Scope element  and choose Add &gt;  Termination Handler.<br>
  An empty container element appears. </li>
  <li>From the Palette, drag one or several activities that will be  executed and place them inside the Termination Handler container. Configure the properties of each activity. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
