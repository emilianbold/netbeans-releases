<h2>Web Service Orchestration  Basics </h2>
<!---- This topic, when finished, will give a very, very brief overview of BPMN/BPEL and the IDE's WSOrch features, and then of the steps involved in using the IDE 
to orchestrate web services.  It recapitulates the "creating" part of the GSG or a
quick-start guide, listing the major steps and explaining a little, generically, about each 
step. It then refers the user to the GSG and the Quick Starts. --->
<p> The IDE's BPEL Designer provides a highly graphical environment for  authoring, deploying and testing web-service centric business  processes.    This is often called web service orchestration and is one of  the keystones of service-oriented architecture (SOA). A BPEL process can be thought of as a logical aggregator and  coordinator of web services. In such a process, a collection of partner  web-service components can collaborate synchronously or asynchronously,  participate in long-lived conversations, and support fault handling. Thus, the IDE's BPEL Designer feature extends  the power of service-oriented architecture. </p>
<p>The BPEL modeling environment includes deployment runtime,  and the ability to author, edit, test-run, and debug BPEL processes. The  BPEL Designer feature lets you use drag-and-drop 
functionality to create visual diagrams of  business 
processes to orchestrate web services. The BPEL Designer  feature supports two-way round-trip engineering of processes that are expressed in the Web Services Business Process Execution  Language Version 2.0 (WS-BPEL 2.0, or generically, BPEL). </p>
<p>In the BPEL Designer, you can create a business diagram in the visual Design view or manipulate source code in the Source view. The BPEL source code and its visual diagram are always kept in sync. </p>
<h3>Typical Tasks in Business Process Development </h3>
<p>In the BPEL Designer, you can perform the following tasks 
  to develop a business process. These tasks might iterate, and sometimes the order of tasks changes.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Use the New Project wizard to create a new <a href="create_project.html" title="Creating BPEL Module Projects">BPEL Module project</a> and a <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.compapp.capshelp/org/netbeans/modules/compapp/capshelp/basics/about.html" title="About Composite Applications">Composite Application project</a>. </li>
  <li>Create or import <a href="../windows_editors/add_files.html" title="Adding BPEL Files to BPEL Module Projects">BPEL process files</a> into the BPEL Module project. </li>
  <li>Create or import <a href="../design/import_wsdl_resources.html" title="Adding WSDL and XML Schema Imports">WSDL resources</a> to act as partner services in your business 
    process.</li>
  <li>Import <a href="../design/import_wsdl_resources.html" title="Adding WSDL and XML Schema Imports">XML schema resources</a>. </li>
  <li>Add <a href="../elements/about.html" title="About BPEL Elements">elements</a> to the business process diagram and further define them  by 
    using property editors, custom editors, and pop-up menu options. </li>
