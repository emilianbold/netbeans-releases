<p>The Clone Document feature is a customization option which enables you to clone documents views. If you want to see both the source and the design view of a BPEL process at the same time follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol> 
<li> Open the BPEL file </li>
  <li>
  Right click the tab with the file name and choose Clone document.
  Another tab with the same document will be created.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop one of the tabs to the location you choose: left, right or to the bottom of the screen.  An orange frame will show you where the window you are dragging will be placed. </li>
</ol>
  Several views of one document are always kept in sync.
  Using the Cloning feature you can simultaneously open the Source and the Design view of the document, or the diagram and the mapper . </p>
