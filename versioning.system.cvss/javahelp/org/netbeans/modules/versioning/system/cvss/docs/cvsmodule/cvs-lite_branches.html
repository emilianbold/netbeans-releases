        <h2>Working with Branches</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's CVS support enables you to maintain different versions of an entire 
            code base using branches. Branches are created by attaching a branch tag to 
            a file or folder in the repository. When you modify files in a branch it does 
            not affect the files in the main code line or "trunk". You can, however, merge 
            any modifications you make in the branch back to the trunk at a later stage.</p>
            
        <h3>Checking out Branches</h3>
        
        <p>If you need to edit files on a branch that already exists, you can check out 
            the branch to copy the files to a local working directory. You must, however, 
            create a new local working directory within which to checkout the branch.</p>

        <h4>To check out a branch to a local working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; CVS &gt; Checkout from the main menu.</li>
            
            <li>On the first page of the CVS Checkout wizard, specify the location of the 
                CVS repository by choosing a preconfigured URL from the CVS Root drop-down 
                menu. If you are unfamiliar with the syntax, click the Edit button and 
                enter the required information in the Edit CVS Root dialog.</li>
            <li>Enter your repository password in the Password field.</li>
            <li>If you are using a proxy, click the Proxy Configuration button and enter
                the required information. Click Next.</li>
            <li>On the Module to Checkout page, specify the files and directories you
                want to check out in the Module field or click the Browse button to
                choose from a list of all modules in the repository.</li>
            <li>Specify the branch, revision number, or tag to checkout in the
                Branch field or click the Browse button to choose from a list of all
                branches in the repository.</li>
            <li>Specify the local working directory into which you want to check
                out the selected branches. Alternately, you can click the Browse 
                button to navigate to the desired directory on your system.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to check out the files. The IDE initiates the checkout 
                command for the branch. The IDE's Status bar, displaying in the
                lower right corner of the IDE, indicates the progress of the files 
                downloading from the repository branch to your local working 
                directory.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Switching to a Branch</h3>
        
        <p>If you want to switch a project, directory, or file to a branch that already 
            exists for stabilization or experimentation purposes, you can do so using 
            the Switch to Branch command.</p>
            
        <h4>To switch to a branch:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, or Versioning window, right-click the file or 
                folder you want to be the root of your branch and choose CVS &gt; Switch 
                to Branch.</li>
            <li>In the Switch to Branch dialog, enter a Branch name or click Browse to 
                see a list of available branches.</li>
            <li>Click Switch. The IDE moves the selected file to the specified branch 
                by adding a branch tag.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Creating a Branch</h3>
        
        <p>If you want to work on a separate version of your file system for
            stabilization or experimentation purposes, you can do so by creating a
            branch. Branches are created by adding a branch tag to a project,
            directory, or file revision.</p>
            
        <h4>To create a branch:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, or Versioning window, right-click the file 
                or folder you want to be the root of your branch and choose CVS
                &gt; Branch.</li>
            <li>In the Branch dialog, enter a Branch name or click Browse to see
                a list of available branches.</li>
            <li>If you want to tag the file or directory, select the Tag Before
                Branching checkbox and enter a Tag name.</li>
            <li>If you want to switch to the new branch after creating it, select
                the Switch to This Branch Afterwards checkbox.</li>
            <li>Click Branch. The IDE creates the branch by adding a branch tag to 
                the selected file or directory.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When you add a branch tag, the branch is created in the repository
                immediately and does not require using the Commit command.</li>
        </ul>
