        <h2>About CVS</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a type of version control system that aids 
            developer groups working with shared source files in common repositories by 
            managing file revision history information.</p>
            
        <p>The IDE's CVS built-in support enables you to manage changes to version-controlled 
            files as you work. In the IDE, you can call CVS commands on both files and 
            directories in the Projects, Files, 
            <a href="csh/cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a>, and Favorites 
            windows. For an overview of the typical workflow when using CVS in the IDE, 
            see <a href="cvs-lite_overview.html">Working with CVS.</a></p>
            
        <h3>The IDE's CVS Tools</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE provides several tools to simplify the process of working with 
            version-controlled files, including:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Versioning Window</strong>. Provides an 
                <a href="cvs-lite_using.html#tracking">interface displaying local changes</a> in 
                version-controlled files.</li>
            <li><strong>Search History Window</strong>. Enables you to 
                <a href="cvs-lite_histories.html">search for specific revisions</a> of
                version-controlled files.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Diff Viewer</strong>. Enables you to graphically
                <a href="cvs-lite_diff.html">compare differences</a> in file revisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Merge Conflict Resolver</strong>. Assists you in 
                <a href="cvs-lite_mergeresolve.html">resolving conflicts</a> that occur 
                when committing conflicting file versions to the repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Window</strong>. Provides an automatic monitoring view of 
                active VCS operations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>CVS Visualization Features</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE provides several <a href="cvs-lite_status.html">file status information</a> 
            tools that simplify the process of working with version-controlled files, 
            including:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color Coding</strong>. Enables you to view the current status 
                of version-controlled files.</li>
            <li><strong>Annotations</strong>. Enables you to view revision and author 
                information for each line of version-controlled files.</li>
        </ul>
