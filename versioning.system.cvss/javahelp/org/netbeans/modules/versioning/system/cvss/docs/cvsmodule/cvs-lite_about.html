        <h2>About CVS </h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>CVS (Concurrent Version System) is a type of version control system 
        that aids developer groups working with
        shared source files in common repositories by managing file revision
        history information.</p>
        <p>The IDE's CVS built-in support enables you to
        manage changes to version-controlled files as you work. In the IDE, you
        can call CVS commands on both files and directories
        in the Projects, Files, Versioning, and Favorites window. For an
        overview of the typical workflow when using CVS in the IDE, see <a
        href="cvs-lite_overview.html">Working with CVS.</a> </p>
        <h3>The IDE's CVS Tools</h3>
        <p>The IDE provides several tools to simplify the process of working
        with version controlled files including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Versioning Window</b>. Provides an <a
            href="cvs-lite_using.html">overview of the changes in
            version-controlled files</a>. </li>
            <li><b>Search History Window</b>. Enables you to <a
            href="cvs-lite_histories.html">search for specific revisions of
            version-controlled files</a>. </li>
            <li><b>Graphical Diff Viewer</b>. Enables you to <a
            href="cvs-lite_diff.html">compare differences in file revisions</a>
            graphically. </li>
            <li><b>Merge Conflict Resolver</b>. Assists you in resolving
            conflicts that occur when <a href="cvs-lite_merge.html">merging file
            revisions</a>. </li>
            <li><b>Output Window</b>. Provides automatic <a
            href="cvs-lite_using.html">monitoring of active VCS
            operations</a>. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You may also use a different VCS system with the IDE, however, 
            activating other VCS modules will disable the IDE's built-in CVS system.
            For more information, see <a href="cvs-lite_non-cvs.html">Working with 
            Other Version Control Systems</a>.</li>
        </ul>
