        <p> Version control systems (VCS) aid developer groups working with shared source
        files in common repositories by managing file revision history information.
        The IDE's various VCS tools provide a means of effectively managing changes
        to version-controlled files. </p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To work with VCS in the IDE, you must register
            a VCS working directory with the IDE's Versioning Manager. For more information,
            see <a href="vcs_repositorysetup.html">Setting Up VCS.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CVS Lite Tools</h3>
        <p>The IDE also provides several tools to simplify the process of working with
        version controlled files including:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Versioning Window</b>. Enables you to <a href="vcs_usingvcs.html#viewing">view
            the evolution of changes in version-controlled files</a>.
            <li><b>VCS Output Window</b>. Provides automatic <a href="vcs_usingvcs.html#monitor">monitoring
            of active VCS operations</a>.
            <li><b>Versioning Manager</b>. Assists you in <a href="vcs_repositorysetup.html#register">registering
            VCS working directories</a>
            and <a href="vcs_configure.html">configuring their settings</a>.
            <li><b>Graphical Diff Viewer</b>. Enbles you to <a href="vcs_diff.html">compare
            differences in file revisions</a> graphically
            <li><b>Merge Conflict Resolver</b>. Assists you in resolving conflicts that occur
            when <a href="vcs_merge.html">merging
            file revisions</a>. 
            <li><b>VCS Groups Window</b>. Simplifies
            tracking of file status and execution of VCS commands for entire groups
            of files. For more information, see <a href="vcs_groups.html">Using
            VCS Groups</a>.<p></p>
        </ul>
        <p>In the IDE, you can call VCS commands on both files and directories in the
        Files window, Versioning window and Favorites window.</p>

        <h3>VCS Clients and the IDE</h3>
        <p>The IDE's built-in CVS client provides versioning
        functionality without requiring installation of any additional software on
        your computer. You can, however, use other VCS clients with the IDE via the
        included VCS profiles. VCS profiles provide commands and variables which enable
        the IDE to interact with the VCS executable installed on your computer. </p>
        <p>The IDE includes profiles for the following VCS programs:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="vcs_cvs.html"><b>Concurrent Versioning System</b><sup><tt>TM</tt></sup> 
            (CVS)</a></li>
            <li>Visual Source Safe<sup><tt>TM</tt></sup> (VSS)</li>
            <p>You can download additional profiles at <tt>http://vcsgeneric.netbeans.org/profiles/index.html</tt>.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You must have the appropriate VCS executable installed
            on your computer to work with version control systems other than
            CVS.</li>
        </ul>
