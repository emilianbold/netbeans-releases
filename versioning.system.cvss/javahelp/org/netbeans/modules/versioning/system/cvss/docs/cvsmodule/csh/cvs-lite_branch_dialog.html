	<h2>CVS: Branch Dialog Box</h2>
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
	<p>The CVS Branch dialog box enables you to specify the branch when creating a new branch or adding 
            files to an existing branch.</p>
            
	<p>You access this dialog box either by choosing Versioning &gt; CVS &gt; Branches &gt; Branch from 
            the main menu, or by right-clicking a file or folder and selecting CVS &gt; Branch.</p>
            
	<p>Specify the following in the Branch dialog box:</p>
        
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Branch name.</strong> Enter a branch name in the text field or click Browse to see a 
                list of available branches. Entering a new branch name allows you to create a new branch.</li>
	</ul>
        
	<p>When creating a new branch or moving files or folders to an existing branch, you can set the 
            following options:</p>

        <ul>	
	    <li><strong>Tag Before Branching.</strong> If selected, the name specified in the Tag Name text 
                field is attached to the root of the branch. This can be useful for marking where the branch 
                was made. The branch is created after the tag is attached to the file or folder.</li>
	    <li><strong>Switch to This Branch Afterwards.</strong> If selected, the local working directory 
                is switched to the specified branch after the branch is created.</li>
	</ul>
