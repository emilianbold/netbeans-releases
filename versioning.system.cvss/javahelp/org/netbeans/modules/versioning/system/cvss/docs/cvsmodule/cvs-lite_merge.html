        <p>The Merge command is useful for incorporating changes made on
        different branches of the repository with your local working copy of a
        file or directory. Any changes you make on one branch can be merged to
        another
        branch, including back to the trunk. You can also merge the difference
        between two earlier revisions with your local working copy.</p>
        <p><b>To merge a file from a branch with your local working copy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, Favorites, or Versioning window,
            right-click the files or folders that you want to merge into your local
            working copy and choose CVS &gt; Merge Changes from
            Branch. </li>
            <li>In the dialog that appears, select the branch you want to merge
            the changes from. If you want to merge changes from a branch other than the
            trunk, enter the branch name or click Browse to see a list of available
            branches. </li>       
            <li>If you want to merge changes after a specific tag, select the
            Merge Only Changes Made after Tag checkbox and designate the tag in the
            Tag Name field. Alternately,
            you can click the Browse buttons to choose from a list of available
            tags.</li>
            <li>If you want to tag the merge, select the Tag Trunk after Merge
            (or Tag <tt>branch_name</tt> after Merge) checkbox and enter the desired tag name. Alternately,
            you can click the Browse buttons to choose from a list of available
            tags.</li>
            <li>Click Merge.
                <p>The IDE incorporates any differences found in the branch version
                into
                your local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's
                status is updated to Merge Conflict to indicate this.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>After merging file changes from a branch to your local working
                directory, you must still commit the changes using the Commit command
                in order for them to added to the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p><b>To merge the difference between two revisions with your working copy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, expand the file's node to reveal the subnodes
            for each revision and branch.</li>
            <li>Control-click the two revision nodes whose changes you want to merge into
            your working copy.
            <li>Right-click either of the revisions and choose Merge With Rev. Differences.
            <p>The IDE incorporates any differences in the revisions into your local
            copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's VCS status changes
            to Merge Conflict to indicate this. </p>
