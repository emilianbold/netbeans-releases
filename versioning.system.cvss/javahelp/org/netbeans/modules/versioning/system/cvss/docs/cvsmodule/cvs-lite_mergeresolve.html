        <p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img src="./images/badgeMergeConflict.gif" alt="Merge Conflict Badge">)
        appears on the file's node and each conflict in the file
        is marked with arrows followed by the lines from the two revisions that caused
        the conflict. </p>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to checking your local
        file into the repository. </li></ul>
        <h4>To resolve merge conflicts graphically with the Merge Conflicts Resolver:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the node of the file whose status is Merge Conflict and choose
            Resolve Conflicts from the contextual menu. The Merge Conflicts Resolver
            is displayed with merge conflicts highlighted in red. </li>
            <li>Use the Next (<img src="./images/next.gif" alt="Next">) and Previous (<img src="./images/prev.gif" alt="Previous">)
            difference buttons in the upper-lefthand corner to navigate to each conflict
            in the file. </li>
            <li>For each conflict, click Accept above the pane  containing the text that
            you wish to accept. The text you chose is  highlighted in green and is displayed
            in the Merge Result pane. The text in the pane you did not choose is highlighted
            in blue.</li>
            <li>
                <p>If neither pane contains the text you want, open your source file and
                edit it manually. When you are done making changes, right-click the node
                of the source file and choose CVS&nbsp;> Update
                from the contextual menu. Then repeat the procedure, beginning with
                Step 1. </p>
            </li>
            <li>After resolving each conflict, click OK to exit the Merge
            Conflict Resolver.
            <p>The IDE updates your local working copy with the desired
            changes. 
        </ol>
        <h4>To resolve conflicts manually in the source file:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Delete the arrows and the text that you do not want for each conflict in
        the file. <li>Save the file.<p>The IDE updates your local working copy with the desired
            changes. </ol>
            <ul class="note">
            <li>Once you have resolved each merge conflict, you still need to commit the file to add your changes to the repository
            copy. For more information, see <a href="vcs_commit.html">Committing Files to a VCS Repository</a>. </li></ul>
