        <h2>Creating and Applying a Patch</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Patch files enable software developers who are not sharing a common
        repository to distribute and integrate changes that have been made to
        the code. The IDE enables you to create and apply patches that update copies of source
        files so that you do not have to incorporate the changes manually. </p>

        <h4>To create a patch file of the differences between a locally
        modified copy of a file and the repository version:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or folder for which you want to create a patch in
            the Projects, Files, or Search History window. </li>
            <li>Choose CVS&nbsp;&gt; Export <tt>&lt;file_name&gt;</tt> Diff
            Patch from the main menu. </li>
            <li>Enter a name for the patch file and specify the location where
            you want to save the patch. </li>
            <li>Click Export.
                <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the
                differences between the source file versions. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Note that the Export Diff Patch command is only available on files 
            and folders which contain local or remote changes 
            that have not already been merged.<br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <!--<h4>To create a patch file of the differences between two repository revisions
        of a source file:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Select the source files from whose differences  you wish to generate the
        patch. </li>
        <li>Right-click  either of the files and choose
        CVS&nbsp;> Patch from
        the contextual menu. </li>
        <li> In the Patch dialog box, specify the style of  diff output and 
        the revisions you want to compare.
        <p>Choose from the following options:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Context Format.</b> The output shows each difference surrounded
        by two lines of contextual text.</li>
        <li><b>Unidiff Format.</b> The output shows line numbers of every difference
        surrounded by a pair of at-signs (<tt>@@</tt>). Lines where text has
        been added are marked with a plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) and lines where text
        has been deleted are marked with a minus sign (<tt>-</tt>).</li>
        <li><b>Short Patch.</b> The output shows every difference as one line only.</li>
        <li><b>Top Two Diffs.</b> The diff is between the two latest revisions
        of the file or folder.</li>
        <li><b>Revision or Tag.</b> The revision number or tag of the first version
        of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a file (not
        a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag in the
        chooser. </li>
        <li><b>Date.</b> The timestamp of the first version of the file or folder
        to use to create the diff.</li>
        <li><b>The HEAD Revision.</b> The latest revision of the file or folder
        committed to the repository. </li>
        <li><b>Revision or Tag 2.</b> The revision number or tag of the second
        version of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a
        file (not a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag
        in a chooser.</li>
        <li><b>Date 2.</b> The timestamp of the second version of the file or folder
        to use to create the diff.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Click OK.</li>
        <li>In the VCS Output window, ensure that the correct differences are shown.</li>
        <li>Right-click in the output and choose Save To File from the contextual menu.
        <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the differences
        between the source code file versions.
        </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>The CVS&nbsp;> Patch
        command runs on file versions in the repository, not on files in your
        local working directory.</li>

        <a name="ApplyPatch"><h4>To apply a patch to a file or a folder: </h4></a>
        <ol>
        <li>Right-click the file or folder on which you want to apply the patch and
        choose Tools&nbsp;> Apply&nbsp;Patch. </li>
        <li>Type the path or navigate to the patch file you want to apply. </li>
        <li>Click Patch.<p>The differences contained in the patch file are incorporated
        into the file or folder. You should always verify that the patched file
        or folder contains the changes from the patch file after using the Apply
        Patch command.
        </li></ol>-->
        
        <p><b>To apply a patch:</b></p>
        <ol>
        <li>In the Projects, Files, or Favorites window, right-click the file or 
        folder on which you want to apply the patch and choose Tools > Apply Patch.</li>
        <li>Type the path or navigate to the patch file you want to apply.</li>
        <li>Click Patch. </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul class="tip">
            <li>Because patches on folders use relative paths to the files within
            them, folder patches must be applied on the same folder node that the
            patch was created on to insure the patch is applied properly.</li>
            <li>If you are uncertain to which file or directory the patch should 
            be applied, you can find the context information in the patch file itself. 
            Patch files generated by the IDE contain the context in which the patch 
            was originally created in the first few lines of the file. </li>
