        <h2>Creating and Applying a Patch</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Patch files enable software developers who are not sharing a common repository
            to distribute and integrate changes that have been made to the code. The IDE 
            enables you to create and apply patches that update copies of source files so 
            that you do not have to incorporate the changes manually.</p>

        <h4>To create a patch file:</h4>
   
        <ol>
            <li>Select a versioned file (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites window)
                for which you want to create a patch.</li>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Export Diff Patch from the main menu. The Export Diff 
                Patch dialog opens.</li>
            <li>In the dialog, enter a name for the patch file and specify the location where
                you want to save the patch.</li>
            <li>Click Export. A patch file is created in the specified location containing 
                the differences between the source file versions.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Note that the Export Diff Patch command is only available on files and folders 
                which contain local or remote changes that have not already been merged.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To apply a patch to a local file or folder:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a versioned file or folder (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites 
                window) on which you want to apply the patch.</li>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Apply Diff Patch from the main menu. The Apply Diff 
                Patch dialog displays.</li>
            <li>In the dialog, type the path or navigate to the patch file you want to apply.</li>
            <li>Click Patch. The patch is applied to the selected file and a dialog opens, 
                confirming that the patch was applied successfully. Click Yes to view changes
                in the IDE's <a href="cvs-lite_diff.html">Diff Viewer</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Because patches on folders use relative paths to the files within
                them, folder patches must be applied on the same folder node that the
                patch was created on to ensure that the patch is applied properly.</li>
            <li>If you are uncertain to which file or directory the patch should 
                be applied, you can find the context information in the patch file itself. 
                Patch files generated by the IDE contain the context in which the patch 
                was originally created in the first few lines of the file.</li>
        </ul>
