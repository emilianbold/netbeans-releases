	<h2>CVS: History Viewer</h2>
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
         
	<p>The IDE's Search History window enables you to view a summary of a file's evolution
            over time based on revision number. The Search History window also allows you to 
            <a href="#revert">revert</a> (i.e. rollback) changes to a previous revision.
            
        <p>You open the Search History window by choosing:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Versioning &gt; CVS &gt; Search History from the main menu.</li>
            <li>CVS &gt; Search History from the right-click menu of a versioned 
                file or folder (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites windows).</li>
            <li>Search History from the right-click menu of a file in the 
                <a href="cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning window</a>.</li>
        </ul>
            
	<p>This window enables you to see the history of committed changes for the selected file 
            or folder. You can use the following criteria to search for files or folders:</p>
            
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Message</strong>. Enter the name of a message to search for the revisions of 
                files or folders committed with that message.</li>
	    <li><strong>Username</strong>. Enter a username to search for the revisions of files 
                or folders committed by that user.</li>
	    <li><strong>From</strong>. Enter a tag, branch, revision or date of a message to search 
                for the revisions of files or folders committed after that tag, branch, revision or 
                date. Click the Browse button to search for a branch or tag.</li>
	    <li><strong>To</strong>. Enter a tag, branch, revision or date of a message to search 
                for the revisions of files or folders committed before that tag, branch, revision 
                or date. Click the Browse button to search for a branch or tag.</li>
	</ul>
        
        <p>When you click the Search button, files and folders meeting the specified criteria are 
            displayed in the lower pane of the the Search History window. You can view search results 
            in two unique views: Summary view and Diff view:</p>
            
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Summary</strong>. Displays a list containing the details of the results matching 
                the specified search criteria. Each row corresponds to a revision obtained from the 
                repository. If your search criteria specified a folder, all files contained therein are 
                displayed beneath the revision heading.</li>
	    <li><strong>Diff</strong>. Displays the IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enabling you to compare two 
                revisions side by side. A tree view of the commit results displays above the diff viewer 
                allowing you to arbitrarily select revisions to compare. Expand the tree and click on a 
                revision to compare the changes between the selected revision and the previous revision.</li>
	</ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When working in the Diff view, you can format the table display of the upper tree view.
                To do so, choose List Options &gt; Change Visible Columns from the right-click menu of 
                any selected row. A dialog appears allowing you to specify which columns to display.
                Listed columns include: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>File Revision:</strong> Revision and Name of the File (mandatory)</li>
                    <li><strong>Message:</strong> Commit Message (optional)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time: </strong>Time of Message (optional)</li>
                    <li><strong>User: </strong>Author of the Change (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                You can also change the order in which columns are displayed in the table. To do so, 
                click on a column heading in the table and drag it to the desired location.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4><a name="revert"></a>To revert changes made in a selected revision:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>If you are working in the Summary view, select revision row and either:
                <ul>
                    <li>right-click the row and choose Rollback Changes</li>
                    <li>click Revert in the lower right corner of that row.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>If you are working in the Diff view, select a file revision from the tree 
                view and choose Rollback Changes from the right-click menu.</li>
        </ul>
