        <h2>Working with Version Histories</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Searching the histories of files can be helpful when you need to find specific 
            commits, when backporting bugs for example. The IDE's Search Histories window 
            enables you to view a summary of a file's evolution over time by revision number.</p>
            
         <p>You can view file histories in the IDE's Search History window. To do so, select
            a versioned file (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and choose 
            either CVS &gt; Search History from the right-click menu or Versioning &gt;
            Search History from the main menu. Alternately, in the
            <a href="csh/cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window you can choose 
            Search History from a file's right-click menu.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Searching for Specific Revisions</h3>
        
        <p>Using the Search History window, you can search a file or folder's history for
            versions based on several criteria. The Search Histories window enables you 
            to search for changes in version controlled files by:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Message</strong>. The description submitted with the commit.</li>
            <li><strong>Username</strong>. The author of the commit.</li>
            <li><strong>From Tag</strong>. The tag, revision number, or date from which
                the commit was made.</li>
            <li><strong>To Tag</strong>. The tag, revision number, or date before which 
                the commit was made.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To search for a specific revision:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or folder for which you want to find a specific revision.</li>
            <li>Choose CVS &gt; Search Histories from the right-click menu. The IDE opens the 
                Search History window to display the selected item's revision history.</li>
            <li>Enter search criteria information in the Message, Name, From, and To 
                fields. You can also use the Browse buttons to designate any tag, branch,
                revision, or date you want to limit your search to.</li>
            <li>Click Search. The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
                History window.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you want to view other files that were included in a specific
                commit, you can broaden your search using the <tt>&quot;your_project&quot;</tt> 
                and <tt>Open Projects</tt> links to the right of each revision.
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Comparing Revisions in the Search History Window</h3>
        
        <p>You can compare a file with previous versions from within the Search Histories 
            window using the Diff (<img src="images/diff.png">) button.</p>
        
        <h4>To view revision differences in the Search History window:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Diff button in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>Select the revision against which you want to compare your local working
                copy. The IDE displays a diff of the file's revisions within the Search
                History window. Note that you can navigate between the differences
                using the Previous Difference (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" 
                alt="previous difference icon">) and Next Difference 
                (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference icon">) buttons.</li>
        </ol>
