        <h2>Working with Version Histories</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Searching the histories of files can be helpful when you need to
        find specific commits, when backporting bugs for example.
        The IDE's Search Histories window enables you to view a summary of a files' 
        evolution over time by revision number. </p>
        <p>You can open the Search History window by
        choosing CVS &gt; Search History. </p>

        <h3>Searching for Specific Revisions</h3>
        <p>Using the Search History window, you can search a file or folder's history for
        versions based on several criteria.</p>
        <p>The Search Histories window enables you to search for changes in
        version controlled files by: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Message</strong>. The description submitted with the
                commit.<!--Indicates lines that have been changed
                since the earlier revision.-->
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Username</strong>. The author of the commit.<!--Indicates lines that have been added
                since the earlier revision.-->
            </li>
            <li><strong>From Tag</strong>. The tag, revision number, or date from which
            the commit was made.</li>
            <li><b>To Tag. </b>The tag, revision number, or date before which the commit
            was made.<!--Indicates lines that have been added
            since the earlier revision.--><strong><br>
            </strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To search for a specific revision:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or folder for which you want to find a specific revision.</li>
            <li>Choose CVS &gt; Search <tt>filename</tt> History from the main
            menu. Alternately, you can right-click the file or folder and choose 
            CVS > Search Histories from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <p>The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
            History window. </p>
            <li>Enter search criteria information in the Message, Name, From, and
                To fields. You can also use the Browse buttons to designate any tag, branch,
                revision, or date you want to limit your search to.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Click Search.</li>
            <p>The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
            History window.</p>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>If you want to view other files that were included in a specific
            commit, you can broaden your search using the <tt>"your_project"</tt> and <tt>Open
            Projects</tt> links to the right of each revision.
        </ul>
        <h3>Comparing Revisions in the Search History Window</h3>
        <p>You can compare a file with previous versions from within the
        Search Histories window using the Diff button. </p>
        <p><b>To view revision differences in the Search History window:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Diff button in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>Select the revision against which you want to compare your local
            working copy.</li>
            <p>The IDE displays a diff of the file's revisions within the Search
            History window. Note that you can navigate between the differences
            using the Previous Difference and Next Difference buttons.</p>
