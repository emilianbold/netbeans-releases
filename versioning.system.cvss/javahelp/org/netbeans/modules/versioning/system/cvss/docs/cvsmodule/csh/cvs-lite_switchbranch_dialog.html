	<h2>CVS: Switch to Branch Dialog Box</h2>
        
	<p>The CVS Switch to Branch dialog box enables you to switch the selected files
            or folders in your local working directory to either the trunk or another
            branch. Revisions are not merged when you switch from a branch to the trunk 
            or from the trunk to a branch.</p>
            
	<p>You access this dialog box by selecting a file or folder (e.g. in the Projects,
            Files, or Favorites window) and choosing either CVS &gt; Switch to Branch
            from the right-click menu or Versioning &gt; Branches &gt; Switch to Branch
            from the main menu.</p>
                
	<ul class="note">
            <li>CVS Status Labels for files in the Projects, Files or Favorites windows can 
                indicate if you are working from the repository trunk or a specific branch. 
                To activate CVS Status Labels, choose View &gt; Show Versioning Labels from 
                the main menu.</li>
        </ul>
        
	<p>Select one of the following actions:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Switch to Trunk</strong>. If selected, your local working files are 
                switched to the trunk.</li>
	    <li><strong>Switch to Branch</strong>. If selected, your local working files are 
                switched to the specified branch. Enter the name of the branch in the text 
                field or click Browse to see a list of the available branches.</li>
