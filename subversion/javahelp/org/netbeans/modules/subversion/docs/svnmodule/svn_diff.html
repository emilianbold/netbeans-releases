        <p>You can compare two file revisions side-by-side by performing a diff. 
            The Diff command allows you to compare two different revisions through
            a graphical interface.</p>
            
        <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's Graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare different
            versions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the
            differences between the files being compared.</p>
            
        <p>The Previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="Last difference button" 
            height="16" width="16">) and Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" 
            alt="Next difference button" height="16" width="16">) difference
            buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among differences found in
            the file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within
            the Diff Viewer using the Refresh Diff (<img src="images/refresh.png"
            alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">) and Update (<img
            src="images/update.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16"
            width="16">) buttons. When you are finished comparing the files, you
            can commit your changes using the Graphical Diff Viewer's Commit button
            (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16"
            width="16">).</p>
         
        <p>The Graphical Diff Viewer also enables you to select whether to view files 
            containing changes from the local working copy, the repository, as well as
            both simultaneously. To change viewing criteria, click on the appropriate 
            icon:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/locally_mod.png">: local working copy</li>
            <li><img src="images/remotely_mod.png">: repository</li>
            <li><img src="images/both_mod.png">: both local and remote files</li>            
        </ul>
            
        <p>The Graphical Diff Viewer highlights changes in the files using the 
            following colors:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong>. Indicates lines that have been changed
                since the earlier revision.</li>
            <li> <strong>Green</strong>. Indicates lines that have been added
                since the earlier revision.</li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong>. Indicates lines that have been removed
                since the earlier revision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working copy:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the appropriate file node in the Projects, Files, Favorites
                or Subversion window.</li>
            <li>Choose Diff from the right-click menu. The IDE displays the results in 
                the Graphical Diff Viewer in a new tab of the main window.</li>
        </ol>
