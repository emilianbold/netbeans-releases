        <h2>About the IDE's Subversion Support</h2>
        
        <p>Like CVS, Subversion is a type of version control system that aids developer 
            groups working with shared source files in common repositories by managing 
            file revision history information.</p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to manage changes to version-controlled 
            files as you work. In the IDE, you can call Subversion commands on both files 
            and directories in the Projects, Files, Versioning, and Favorites windows.</p>
        
        <p>Subversion is an improvement upon CVS in many ways, such as the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Allows you to rename documents in your repository and keep the whole 
                history of the document's revisions.</li>
            <li>Treats commits as whole entities. If you attempt to commit changes to 
                several files and the commit fails, no files are changed in the repository.</li>
            <li>Has a generally more robust design.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support is similar in style to the IDE's CVS support. 
            If you are used to using CVS in the IDE, you only need to make minor adjustments 
            to start working with the IDE's Subversion support.</p>
        
        <p>For an overview of the typical workflow when using Subversion in the IDE, see 
            the following document:</p>
