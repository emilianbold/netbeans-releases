        <h2>Subversion: Commit Dialog Box</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Subversion Commit dialog box enables you to commit local changes in 
            version-controlled files to the repository. If you have an <a href="#">issue
            tracker</a> set up with your repository, the commit dialog box lets you
            associate your commit action with an existing issue.</p>
            
        <p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a version-controlled file or
            folder that contain local changes and choosing Subversion &gt; Commit. You
            can also access this dialog box by selecting the commit button
            (<img src="../images/commit.png" alt="commit button">) in the 
            <a href="../svn_diff.html">Diff Viewer</a> or the 
            <a href="svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning window</a>.</p>
                
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commit Message</strong>: Type in a message describing your commit action.

                <ul class="note">
                    <li>When entering a commit message, you can view previous messages by clicking 
                        the Recent Messages button (<img src="../images/recent_msgs.png" 
                        alt="recent messages button">) located in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog. A dialog displays, listing recent commit messages.</li>
               <li>If you know you will be repeatedly making commits for the same purpose, 
                        you can set text to be included as a template for commit messages. Click 
                        the Load Template icon (<img src="../images/load_template.png"
                        alt="load templates icon">) in the upper right corner of the dialog to
                        load text from Template file directly into the Commit Message text area.</li>               
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Files to Commit</strong>: View files that will be included in the commit action.
                
                <p>When you click on a field in the Commit Action column, you can specify additional
                    actions by choosing from the drop-down list:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exclude from Commit</strong>: Exclude the selected file from the
                        commit action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add as Text</strong>: Set the MIME type for the file as textual data.
                        (For new files only. New files are displayed in green text.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Add as Binary</strong>: Set the MIME type for the file as binary
                        data. (For new files only. New files are displayed in green text.)</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Update Issue</strong>: Update an issue by associating your commit action
                with an existing issue in your repository's issue tracker.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue Tracker</strong>: Specify the issue tracker that your repository
                        uses, by selecting an issue tracker from the drop-down list. The drop-down
                        provides you with a list of all issue trackers registered with the IDE. If
                        your repository's issue tracker is not registered, click the <strong>New</strong>
                        button to register it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Specify the issue ID. You can do this by typing in
                        the ID, or part of the description.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can also specify the following options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resolve as FIXED</strong>: When selected, the status of the issue is marked as Resolved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add details to commit message and issue</strong>: When selected, the <tt>modify</tt> link in parentheses is enabled. Modify the format of the information that is added to commit messages and issues in the Modify templates dialog box that is displayed, by clicking the <tt>modify</tt> link. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
