        <h2>Setting Up Subversion</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Before you can take advantage of the IDE's Subversion support, you need 
            to have Subversion client software installed on your system. The IDE 
            supports Subversion client versions 1.3.x and higher. The IDE's Subversion 
            support works by interacting with the Subversion client to carry out the 
            commands.</p>
            
        <p>You can download Subversion as either sources or as a binary from the 
        following link:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><object CLASSID="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                    <param name="content" value="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">
                    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</u></html>">
                    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
            </object></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Though the Subversion site does not guarantee the quality of the binary downloads, 
            you might find them easier to work with. For example, the executable binary for 
            Microsoft Windows systems sets up the environment variable that enables your system 
            and the IDE to recognize the Subversion installation. If you do not use an installer, 
            follow the Subversion installation instructions closely to make sure that you set up 
            everything correctly on your system.</p>
            
        <p>After the Subversion client is set up, you can run Subversion commands from the IDE's 
            Versioning &gt; Subversion menu. To check out files from a Subversion repository,
            choose Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Checkout. In the process of checking out, the 
            IDE automatically registers the working directory where your local copies of 
            version-controlled files and their status information will be stored. See 
            <a href="svn_checkout.html">Checking Out Files from a Subversion Repository</a> for 
            more information.</p>
 
        <p>If you have already checked out files from a Subversion repository (using Subversion client 
            1.3.x or higher), the IDE automatically recognizes the files as versioned files if those 
            files are part of an open IDE project or if they are added to the Favorites window. You 
            can call Subversion commands on such files from the Subversion menu or by right-clicking 
            a file or folder and choosing from the Subversion submenu.</p>
