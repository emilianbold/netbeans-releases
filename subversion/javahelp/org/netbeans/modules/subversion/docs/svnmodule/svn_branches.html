        <h3><a name="checkout"></a>Checking out branches</h3>
        
        <p>If you need to edit files on a branch folder that already exists, you can checkout 
            the branch to copy the files to a local working directory. You must however create 
            a new local working directory within which to checkout the branch.</p>
</p>
            
        <h4>To checkout a branch to your local working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Checkout from the main menu. The 
                Subversion Checkout wizard opens.</li>
            <li>In the first panel of the wizard, enter a URL that contains the connection 
                protocol and location to the repository. Depending on your protocol selection
                and connection requirements, enter any required parameters, such as username, 
                password, proxy configuration, etc. Click Next.</li>          
            <li>In the Folders to Checkout panel of the wizard, specify the folder that 
                represents the branch you want to check out in the Repository Folder(s) field.
                You can click the Browse button to choose from a list of all folders in the 
                repository. Specify the revision number if you want to work from a specific 
                revision.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>To checkout only the contents of the folder you are specifying 
                        (i.e. and not the folder itself), select the Skip 
                        &quot;&lt;<tt>selected_folder</tt>&gt;&quot; and checkout only 
                        its content option.</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li>Specify the local working directory into which you want to checkout the 
                selected branch folder. Alternately, you can click the Browse button to 
                navigate to the desired directory on your system.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to check out the branch folder. The IDE initiates the checkout 
                action and the IDE's status bar indicates the progress of the files 
                downloading from the repository to your local working directory. You can 
                also view files being checked out from the Output window (Ctrl-4).</li>
        </ol>
            
        <h3><a name="create"></a>Creating branches</h3>
            
        <p>If you want to work on a separate version of your file system for stabilization 
            or experimentation purposes, you can do so by creating a branch. To create a 
            branch in Subversion, you are effectively copying a version-controlled project
            or folder and adding it to a new location within the repository. The IDE's 
            Subversion support enables you to select a source from either your local working 
            copy, or browse to a location in the repository you are working from. You can 
            create branches in the IDE by choosing Subversion &gt; Copy To from a versioned 
            file or folder's contextual menu.</p>
  
        <h4>To create a branch:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the versioned project or folder (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or 
                Favorites window) that you want to be the root of your branch and choose 
                Subversion &gt; Copy To. The Subversion Copy dialog box opens.</li>
            <li>Under Source, select Local Folder if you want to create a branch from 
                your local working copy, otherwise select Remote Folder to specify the 
                version maintained in the repository.
            
                <ul>
                    <li>You can specify a specific revision of the selected item by entering 
                        a revision number in the Revision text box. Clicking the Search button 
                        adjacent to the Revision text box allows you to view revisions maintained 
                        in the repository.</li>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Skip selected Folder and copy only its Contents</strong> 
                        option if you want to avoid including the selected folder when creating 
                        a copy.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Under Destination, select the target location for the new branch copy. In 
                Repository Location, type in a path relative to the repository, otherwise 
                click the Browse button to open a new dialog that aids in browsing the 
                repository folders.</li>
            <li>Enter a description for the new branch folder in the Copy Description text
                area. If you want to switch to the branch after creating it, select the
                Switch to Copy checkbox.</li>
            <li>Click Copy. The IDE creates the branch by copying the folder contents to the 
                specified location in the repository.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3><a name="switch"></a>Switching to a Branch</h3>
        
        <p>If you want to switch your local working copy to point to a branch or other
            location in the repository, you can do so using the Subversion Switch to 
            command.</p>
            
        <h4>To switch to a branch or other location in the repository:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a versioned file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or Favorites 
                window) and choose either Subversion &gt; Switch to Copy from the right-click 
                menu or Versioning &gt; Switch to from the IDE's main menu. The Subversion Switch
                dialog box opens.</li>
            <li>For Repository Folder, enter the branch folder you want to switch to, or click 
                Browse to view a list of all locations in the repository.
            
                <ul>
                    <li>If you need to specify a previous revision, enter the revision number 
                        for the selected location. Leave blank if you require the most recent 
                        revision. To display a log of all revisions for the selected location, 
                        you can click the Search button.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Click Switch. The IDE updates your working copy to reflect the content maintained
                by the newly selected branch location in the repository. Note that any differences 
                arising between your local working copy and the location that you are switching to 
                will be overwritten by the new location.</li>
        </ol>
