        <h2>Viewing File Status Information</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view and manage the evolution
        of changes in version-controlled files.</p>
        
        <h3>Viewing Revision Information<a name="viewing"></a></h3>
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view version status information in 
        many of the IDE's windows, including the Versioning, Projects, Files, and Favorites 
        windows. The Versioning window, however, represents the primary place within which 
        to manage version-controlled files by displaying a list of all of the new, modified, 
        removed, and out-of-date files in the currently selected project or directory.</li>
        <p>To open the Versioning window, either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Versioning (Ctrl+8) from the main menu</li>
            <li>Choose Show Changes from the right-click menu of a version-controlled folder 
            from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window</li>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Show Changes (or Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Show 
            Changes) from the main menu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support provides file status information in the following
        ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Status Labels.</b> Textual indication of file status in the Versioning, 
            Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. To display status labels, choose View 
            &gt; Show Versioning Labels from the main menu.</li>
            <li><b>Status Color.</b> Graphical indication of file status in the Versioning, 
            Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><b>Status Badges.</b> Graphical indication of the status of files contained 
            within your project, folder, and package nodes. Displayed in the Projects, Files, 
            and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><b>Revision Annotations.</b> Displays commit message, author, date, and 
            revision number information in the left margin of files open in the Source Editor. 
            To display annotations, select a versioned file in either the Projects, Files, and 
            Favorites window, then choose Show Annotations from its right-click menu. 
            Alternatively, choose Versioning, &gt; Show Annotations from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The IDE displays version-controlled files using the following color coding and font styles:
            <table summary="The left column lists the task name. The right column lists the steps to perform."
                border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

                        <td><strong>Green.</strong> Indicates that the file is

                        <td><strong>Grey.</strong> Indicates that the file is ignored by CVS 
                        and will not be included when calling versioning commands.</td>
                    </tr>

                            CVS commands, however, work as usual. Note that files 
                            displayed in the strikethrough style only appear in the Versioning 
                            window and Commit dialog. They will not appear in Diff panes, nor  
                            will their parent folders (or packages) display badges 
                            if they are modified. </p>

        <p>Current VCS file status is indicated by adding the following badges
        to project, package and directory icons:

                        modified or new files. In the case of packages, this badge applies only
                        to the package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge
                        indicates local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>

                        the repository copy of the file contains changes which conflict with
                        the local version. In case of packages, this badge applies only to the
                        package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge
                        indicates local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>

        <!--<h3>Tracking Changes in the Versioning Window <a name="monitor"></a></h3>
        <p>The Versioning window presents a real-time view of the changes in
        selected directories. It opens at the bottom of the IDE whenever you
        view changes made in version-controlled files. By default, the
        Versioning window displays a list of all modified files within the
        selected package or folder. 
        <p>Using the filter buttons in the toolbar,
        you can limit the list of displayed files to either locally or remotely
        modified files. The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons
        that enable you to invoke the most common CVS tasks on all files
        displayed in the list. </p>
        <p>The following common CVS commands are available in the Versioning window's toolbar: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Refresh Status.</b></li>
        <li><b>Diff All.</b></li>
        <li><b>Update All.</b></li>
        <li><strong>Commit All.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To open the Versioning window, choose CVS &gt; Show
        All Changes. Alternately, you can right-click any project, directory,
        or file that is in a CVS working directory and choose CVS &gt; Show
        Changes.</p>-->
