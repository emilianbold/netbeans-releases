        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view and manage the evolution
        of changes in version-controlled files.</p>
        
        <h3>Viewing Revision Information<a name="viewing"></a></h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view version status information in 
            many of the IDE's windows, including the <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a>, 
            Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. The Versioning window, however, represents 
            the primary place within which to manage version-controlled files by displaying a 
            list of all of the new, modified, and removed files in the currently selected project 
            or directory.</p>
        
        <h4>To open the Versioning window, choose either:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Subversion &gt; Show Changes from the right-click menu of a version-controlled 
                file or folder from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window.</li>
            <li>Versioning &gt; Show Changes (Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Show 
                Changes) from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Versioning &gt; Subversion from the main menu.</li>                
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The IDE's Subversion support provides file status information in the following ways:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Status Labels</strong>. Textual indication of file status in the Versioning, 
                Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. To display status labels, choose View 
                &gt; Show Versioning Labels from the main menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Color</strong>. Graphical indication of file status in the Versioning, 
                Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Badges</strong>. Graphical indication of the status of files contained 
                within your project, folder, and package nodes. Displayed in the Projects, Files, 
                and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Revision Annotations</strong>. Displays commit message, author, date, and 
                revision number information in the left margin of files open in the Source Editor. 
                To display annotations, select a versioned file and choose Show Annotations (or 
                Subversion &gt; Show Annotations) from its right-click menu. Alternatively, choose 
                Versioning, &gt; Show Annotations from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The IDE displays version-controlled files using the following color coding and font styles:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <th>Color Coding</th>
                <th align="center">Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/green_status.png" alt="green status"></td>
                <td><strong>Green</strong>. Indicates that the file is a new
                    local file that does not yet exist in the repository.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/blue_status.png" alt="blue status"></td>
                <td><strong>Blue</strong>. Indicates that the file has been 
                    modified locally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/red_status.png" alt="red status"></td>
                <td><strong>Red</strong>. Indicates that the file contains conflicts.
                    You must employ the Resolve Conflicts command (Subversion &gt; Resolve 
                    Conflicts) for such files.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/grey_status.png" alt="grey status"></td>
                <td><strong>Grey</strong>. Indicates that the file is ignored by Subversion 
                    and will not be included when calling versioning commands. In the
                    <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning window</a>, grey 
                    text signifies deleted files.</td>
            </tr>                    
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/strikethrough_status.png" alt="strike-through status"></td>
                <td><strong>Strike-through</strong>. Indicates that the file is excluded when 
                    calling the Commit command. All other Subversion commands, however, work as 
                    usual. Note that files displayed in the strike-through style only appear in 
                    the Versioning window and Commit dialog. They will not appear in Diff panes, 
                    nor will their parent folders (or packages) display badges if they are modified.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <br>
        <p>Current Subversion file status is indicated by adding the following badges
            to project, package and directory icons:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <th>Badge</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/blue_badge.png" alt="blue badge"></td>
                <td><strong>Locally Modified Badge</strong>. A blue badge on a folder or 
                    package node marks folders or packages that contain locally modified 
                    or new files. In the case of packages, this badge applies only to the 
                    package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge indicates 
                    local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="images/red_badge.png" alt="red badge"></td>
                <td><strong>Conflict Badge</strong>. A red badge on a folder or package node
                    marks folders or packages that contain files for which the repository 
                    copy of the file contains changes which conflict with the local version. 
                    In case of packages, this badge applies only to the package itself and not 
                    its subpackages. For folders, the badge indicates local modifications in 
                    that folder or any of its subfolders.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Note that the parent folders (or packages) of files excluded from commits
                and displayed in the strike-through style will not display badges if they 
                are modified.</li>
