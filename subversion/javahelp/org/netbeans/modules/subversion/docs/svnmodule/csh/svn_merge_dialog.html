        <h2>Subversion: Merge Dialog Box</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Subversion Merge dialog box enables you to incorporate changes from a specific
            repository revision into your local working copy of a file or folder. You can 
            also specify changes from a given range of revisions from the repository.</p>
            
        <p>The Merge dialog box can be accessed by selecting a version-controlled file 
            or folder (e.g. in the Projects, Files or Favorites window) and either 
            choosing Subversion &gt; Merge Changes from the right-click menu or Versioning
            &gt; Merge Changes from the main menu.</p>
            
        <p>In the Merge Changes dialog box, you must specify the following fields:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Merge From.</strong> Select one of the following types of merge:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One Repository Folder.</strong> Port changes from one repository folder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two Repository Folders.</strong> Port changes from two repository folders.</li>
                    <li><strong>One Repository Folder Since Its Origin.</strong> Port changes that have 
                        occurred between the time of the folder's creation and the revision number that 
                        you specify in the Ending Revision Field.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Based on your selection above, the dialog dynamically updates to reflect the required fields.
            For example, if you chose to merge from two repository folders, combo boxes for the first
            and second repository folders display, and the preview is modified accordingly. Likewise, if 
            you chose to merge from one repository folder since its origin, you need only specify the
            location of the repository folder in the Repository Folder combo box.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Repository Folder</strong>. The folder from which you want to port changes. (If 
                you select Two Repository Folders in the Merge From field, this field is replaced by 
                First Repository Folder and Second Repository Folder fields.) Alternatively click Browse 
                to open a dialog that displays all available folders in the repository.</li>
            <li><strong>Starting Revision</strong>. If merging from a single revision, enter the revision 
                number. If merging changes that occurred within a range of revisions, enter the starting
                point of that range.</li>
            <li><strong>Ending Revision</strong>. If merging changes that occurred within a range of 
                revisions, enter the ending point of that range.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Click Merge to initiate the merge. The IDE incorporates any differences found in the selected 
            revision to the local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's status is updated to 
            Merge Conflict to indicate this.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>After merging file changes to your local working directory, you must still commit the 
            changes using the Commit command in order for them to be added to the repository.</li>
        </ul>
