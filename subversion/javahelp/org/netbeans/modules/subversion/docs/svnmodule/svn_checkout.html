        <h2>Checking Out Files From a Remote Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>In order to work on shared files located in a remote repository, you
            need to copy the necessary files and directories to your local working
            directory. This is done by checking out the files from the repository.</p>
            
        <h4>To check out files from a remote repository:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Checkout from the main menu. The 
                Subversion Checkout wizard opens.</li>
            <li>In the first panel of the wizard, enter a URL that contains the connection 
                protocol and the location of the repository.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>If you enter a protocol such as <tt>http://</tt>, <tt>https://</tt>, 
                        or <tt>svn://</tt>, User and Password fields appear in the wizard. 
                        Fill in these fields as necessary.</li>
                    <li>If you enter <tt>svn+ssh://</tt>, you must supply the command to 
                        establish the external tunnel.</li>
                    <li>If you are using a proxy, click the Proxy Configuration button
                        and enter the required information.</li>
                </ul>
            
                Click Next.</li>
                
            <li>In the Folders to Checkout panel of the wizard, specify the folder that 
                you want to check out in the Repository Folder(s) field or click the
                Browse button to choose from a list of all folders in the repository.
                
                <ul>
                    <li>To checkout only the contents of the folder you are specifying 
                        (i.e. and not the folder itself), select the Skip 
                        &quot;&lt;<tt>selected_folder</tt>&gt;&quot; and checkout only 
                        its content option.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>If you need to specify a revision number, enter the information in the 
                Repository Revision field or click the Browse button to view and select 
                from a list of all revisions in the repository.</li>
            <li>Specify the local folder into which you want to check out the selected 
                folders. Alternately, you can click the Browse button to navigate to 
                the desired directory on your system.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to check out the files. The IDE initiates the checkout 
                action and the IDE's status bar indicates the progress of the files 
                downloading from the repository to your local working directory. You can 
                also view files being checked out from the Output window (Ctrl-4).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Select the Scan for NetBeans projects after Checkout option if you intend
                to immediately work with the checked-out sources. If the sources contain 
                projects, a dialog will appear prompting you to open them in the IDE. If 
                the sources do not contain a project, the dialog will appear prompting you 
                to create a new project from the sources and then open them in the IDE. 
                When you create a new project for such sources, select the appropriate 
                project category and then use the &quot;With Existing Sources&quot; 
                template in that category.</li>
