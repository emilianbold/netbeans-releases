        <h2>Checking Out Files From a Remote Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>In order to work on shared files located in a remote repository, you
            need to copy the necessary files and directories to your local working
            directory. This is done by checking out the files from the repository.</p>
            
        <p><strong>To check out files from a Subversion repository:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Subversion &gt; Checkout from the main menu.</li>
            <li>On the Subversion Checkout page of the wizard, fill in a URL that 
                contains the connection protocol and the location of the repository.
                
                <br>If you enter a protocol such as <tt>http</tt>, <tt>https</tt>,
                or <tt>svn+ssh</tt>, User and Password fields appear in the wizard. 
                Fill in those fields as necessary.
                
                <br>If you are using a proxy, click the Proxy Configuration button
                and enter the required information.</li>
            <li>On the Folders to Checkout page of the wizard, specify the folder
                that you want to check out in the Repository Folder(s) field or click 
                the Browse button to choose from a list of all folders in the repository.</li>
            <li>If you need to specify a revision number, enter the information in the 
                Repository Revision field or click the Browse button to choose from a 
                list of all revisions in the repository.</li>
            <li>Specify the local folder into which you want to check out the selected 
                folders. Alternately, you can click the Browse button to navigate to 
                the desired directory on your system.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to check out the files.
                <br>The IDE initiates the <tt>checkout</tt> command and the IDE's status bar
                indicates the progress of the files downloading from the repository to your
                local working directory. You can also view files being checked out from the 
                Output window (Ctrl+4)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If the checked-out sources contain a project, a dialog will appear 
                prompting you to open them in the IDE. If the sources do not contain 
                a project, the dialog will appear prompting you to create a new project 
                from the sources and then them in the IDE. When you create a new project 
                for such sources, select the project category and then use the "With 
                Existing Sources" template in that category.</li>
