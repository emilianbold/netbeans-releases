        <h2>Recovering Deleted Files</h2>

        <p>When working with version-controlled sources, you may sometimes find it useful 
            to be able to recover locally deleted files from the repository. The IDE's 
            Subversion support enables you to recover versioned files by performing a 
            revert delete action on files maintained in your local working copy.</p>
        
        <h4>To revert deletes made to files in your local working copy:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Select the project or folder that previously contained the deleted files 
                (e.g. from the Projects, Files or Favorites window) and choose Subversion 
                &gt; Show Changes from the right-click menu. The Versioning window opens 
                in the bottom panel of the IDE displaying file changes.</li>
            <li>Note that the file names of recently deleted files display in grey text with
                with status listed as Locally Deleted. Select the file(s) you want to recover
                then choose Revert Delete from the right-click menu.</li> 
            <li>In the Confirm Overwrite dialog that displays, click Yes to enable the IDE 
                to recover the file from the repository. The file disappears from the
                Versioning window and is relisted in the project directory within your
                local working copy.</li>
        </ul>
