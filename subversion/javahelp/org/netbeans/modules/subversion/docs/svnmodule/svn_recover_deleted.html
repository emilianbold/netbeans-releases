        <p>When working with version-controlled sources, you may sometimes find it useful 
            to be able to recover locally deleted files from the repository. The IDE's 
            version control support enables you to recover versioned files by performing 
            a revert delete action on files maintained in your local working copy.</p>
        
        <h4>To revert deletes made to files in your local working copy:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the project or folder that previously contained the deleted files 
                (e.g. from the Projects, Files or Favorites window) and choose Subversion 
                &gt; Show Changes from the right-click menu. The Versioning window opens 
                in the bottom panel of the IDE displaying file changes. The file names of 
                recently deleted files display in grey text with with status listed as 
                Locally Deleted.</li> 
            <li>Right-click the file(s) you want to recover and choose Revert Delete.</li> 
            <li>In the Confirm Overwrite dialog that displays, click Yes to enable the IDE 
                to recover the file from its local history repository. The file disappears 
                from the Versioning window and is relisted in the project directory within 
                your local working copy.</li>
        </ol>
