	<h2>Subversion: Diff Viewer</h2
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
	<p>The IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enables you to <a href="../svn_diff.html">compare 
            revisions</a> of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences 
            between the files being compared.</p>
            
	<p>You access the Diff Viewer in one of the following manners:</p> 
            
        <ul>
            <li>select a version-controlled file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files or 
                Favorites window) and choose either Subversion &gt; Diff from the right-click menu or
                Versioning &gt; Diff from the main menu.</li>
            <li>select the Diff view from the <a href="svn_history_viewer.html">History Viewer</a> 
                (e.g. choose Subversion &gt; Search History from a selected file's right-click menu), then
                select a revision from the provided table.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The Diff Viewer tool bar provides you with the following functionality:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Choose whether to view files containing changes from the local working copy, 
                the repository, as well as both simultaneously. To change viewing criteria, 
                click the appropriate icon:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/locally_mod.png" alt="locally modified icon">: 
                        Show locally modified files.</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/remotely_mod.png" alt="remotely modified icon">: 
                        Show remotely modified files.</li>
                        <li><img src="../images/both_mod.png" alt="locally and remotely modified icon">: 
                        Show both locally and remotely modified files.</li>            
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Navigate among differences found in the compared files. Choose to view differences 
                as they appear from top to bottom by clicking the appropriate icon:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">: Go to 
                        previous difference.</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">: Go to next 
                        difference.</li>
                </ul></li>
        
            <li>Refresh the status of the diff (e.g. in the event that changes to your local
                working directory have been made externally), and update the status of the 
                repository versions of files listed in the diff:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/refresh.png" alt="refresh diff button">: Refresh Diff.</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/update.png" alt="update button">: Update the selected item
                        from the repository.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Commit any changes contained in your local working directory:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/commit.png" alt="commit button">: Commit the selected 
                        item to the repository.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you choose to open the Diff Viewer on a selected item, all files contained in the 
            item display in the table located above the graphical viewer (In the event that you select
            a single file, only that file is displayed). The table lists all modified files and 
            organizes information based on the following column headings:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File</strong>. The name of the file.</li>
            <li><strong>Status</strong>. The status of the file (i.e. modified locally or remotely).</li>            
            <li><strong>Location</strong>. The relative path of the file found in the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To view differences between two versions of a file, select the table row corresponding to 
            the desired file.</p>
        
        <h4>The Diff Viewer provides the following UI components:</h4>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Differences between compared files are highlighted using the following colors:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="color:#b8cfe5;font-weight:bold">Blue</span>. Indicates 
                        lines that have been changed since the earlier revision.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:#b4ffb4;font-weight:bold">Green</span>. Indicates 
                        lines that have been added since the earlier revision.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:#ffa0b4;font-weight:bold">Red</span>. Indicates 
                        lines that have been removed since the earlier revision.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>The following icons allow you to make changes directly to your local working copy:
        
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/insert.png" alt="insert icon">: Inserts the highlighted 
                        text from the previous revision into the current revision.</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">: Removes the highlighted 
                        text from the current version so that it mirrors the previous version.</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">: Reverts the file's 
                        current version to the state of the selected previous version.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
