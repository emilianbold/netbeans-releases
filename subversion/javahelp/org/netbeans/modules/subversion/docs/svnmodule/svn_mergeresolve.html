        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img src="images/conflicts-badge.png" 
            alt="Merge Conflict Badge">) appears on the parent folder (or package) of file. 
            Within the file itself, each conflict is marked with arrows followed by the lines 
            from the two revisions that caused the conflict.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to checking your local file into the 
                repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To resolve merge conflicts graphically with the Merge Conflicts Resolver:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, Favorites, or <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning 
                window</a> window, select the file whose status indicates that there is a conflict 
                and choose Resolve Conflicts from the menu. The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays 
                with merge conflicts highlighted in red.</li>
            <li>Use the Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="Next">) and Previous 
                (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="Previous">) difference buttons in the upper-left 
                corner to navigate to each conflict in the file.</li>
            <li>For each conflict, click Accept above the pane containing the text that you wish to accept.
                Once you have chosen the correct text, it is highlighted in green and displayed in the 
                Merge Result pane. The text you did not choose is highlighted in blue.</li>
            <li>If neither pane contains the text you want, exit the Merge Conflict Resolver and edit 
                your source file manually. When you are done making changes, right-click the file and 
                choose Resolve Conflicts (or Subversion &gt; Resolve Conflicts) from the contextual menu. 
                Then repeat the procedure, beginning with Step 1.</li>
            <li>After resolving each conflict, click OK to exit the Merge Conflict Resolver. The IDE 
                updates your local working copy with the desired changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Once you have resolved each merge conflict, you still need to <a href="svn_commit.html">commit</a> 
                the file to add your changes to the repository copy.</li>
        </ul>
