        <p>The Subversion Revert Modifications dialog box enables you to revert changes 
            of a file or folder in the repository to a previous revision.</p>
            
        <p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a version-controlled file or 
            folder and choosing Subversion &gt; Revert Modifications.</p>
        
        <p>You can select one of three options:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Revert Local Changes.</strong> Reverts any changes made in your 
                local working copy to the previously committed or updated version.</li>
            <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Single Commit.</strong> Reverts the 
                local working copy to the repository revision made prior to the previous 
                commit. (Specify a revision number in the Revision text field.)</li>
            <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Previous Commits.</strong> Reverts the 
                local working copy to a specified revision from the repository. (Specify 
                starting and ending revision numbers in the corresponding text fields.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can delete any files or folders which were created after the point which 
                you are reverting to by selecting the <strong>Remove Newly Added Files and 
                Folders</strong> option.</li>
        </ul>
