ClassNotFoundHintDispName=Class not found
ClassNotFoundHintDesc=User code refers to a class that is not defined in PHP \
Platform or in project files
AccidentalAssignmentDispName=Possible accidental assignment, assignments in \
conditions should be avoided
AccidentalAssignmentDesc=Using assignment operator (=) instead of comparision \
operator (==) is a frequent cause of bugs. Therefore assignments in conditional \
clauses should be avoided
WrongOrderOfArgsRuleDispName=Argument with a default value should not be preceded \
by argument without a default value
WrongOrderOfArgsRuleDesc=Optional arguments should be grouped \
on the right side for better readability.<br><br>Example offending code:<br>\
<code>function foo($optional=NULL, $required){}</code><br><br>Recommended code:<br>\
<code>function foo($required, $optional=NULL){}</code>
UninitializedVariableDispName=Variable might have not been initialized
UninitializedVariableDesc=User code refers to variable that might not have been \
initialized. It is a good practise to assign initial values to all variables
