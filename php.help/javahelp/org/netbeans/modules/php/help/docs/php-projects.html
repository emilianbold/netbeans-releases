<h2>PHP Projects</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you
	 run and debug those source files. In the IDE, PHP development takes 
         place within a project, though you can also edit, run and debug
         a PHP file that is not in a project. </p>
<p>To create a project, click Ctrl-Shift-N, or click the New Project icon <img 
        src="images/newProject.png" alt="new Project icon">. You can create an empty
    PHP project or you can convert an existing PHP application to a NetBeans project.
    You can also create a project with sources on a remote server, over FTP or SFTP.
    However, it is preferable to use version control with remote projects and use
    the version control system to commit your changes to the remote server.
</p>
<h3>Source File and Metadata locations</h3>
<p>By default, NetBeans IDE places all project files in your web server's public folder 
    (such as /htdocs). The IDE reads the location of your web server from your PHP 
environment. However, you have other options for file locations. These options appear
in the New Project wizard:</p>
<ul><li>Have the NetBeans metadata stored in another folder.</li>
    <li>Copy the source files to another location. With this option, you could keep
    the PHP project in one location (such as the same folder as your Java projects) and
    the IDE could copy it to the public folder of your web server.</li></ul>
<h3>Run Configuration</h3>
<p>Every NetBeans PHP project has at least one run configuration. You set this default 
configuration when you create the project. You can add as many additional run configurations
as you want. In the Projects window, right-click on the project's node and select Set
Configuration to switch between run configurations or add a run configuration.
In a run configuration, you set whether the project runs: </p>
<ul>
    <li>As a local web site, on your local web server (default)</li>
    <li>As a remote web site, over FTP/SFTP. You can also set up <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
            <param name="content" value="https://blogs.oracle.com/netbeansphp/entry/remote_synchronization1">
            <param name="text" value="<html><u>remote synchronization</u></html>">
            <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
            <param name="textColor" value="blue">
        </object>.</li>
    <li>As a command-line script</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frameworks</h3>
<p>NetBeans IDE supports some PHP frameworks. Add a framework to a project when you create
the project, by selecting the framework in the last page of the New PHP Project wizard.
If a project includes framework support, that framework's commands are available in the project's
context menu in the Projects window.</p>
<h3>Opening and Closing Projects</h3>
<p>To open an existing project, click Ctrl-Shift-O or go to File &gt; Open Project. A dialog
opens in which you browse for the project.</p>
<p>To close a project, go to File &gt; Close Project, or right-click the project's node in the
Projects Window and select Close.</p>
<h3>Projects Window</h3>
<p>Your open PHP projects appear in the Projects Window. To open the projects window, click
    Ctrl-1 or go to Window &gt; Projects.</p>
<p>If you right-click on a project's node or a file's node, a context menu appears. For
information about the functionality you can access in the Projects window, select any item
in the Projects window and press F1. The Projects Window help opens.</p>
<h3>Adding Files to a Project</h3>
<p>To add a file to a project, go to the Projects window and select the project's node or the node
for the folder in which you want to place the file. Then open the New File wizard, either by pressing
Ctrl-N or the New Files icon, or through the node's context menu.</p>
