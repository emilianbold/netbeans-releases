<h2>Projects Window (PHP Projects)</h2>
<p>NetBeans IDE's work flow is based on <i>projects</i>. In the case of PHP, a project includes source files, the include path, and all NetBeans IDE metadata.</p>

<p>The Projects window is the main entry point to your project sources. It shows
    a logical view of important project contents. You can open the Projects 
    window by choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1).</p>

<h3>Context Actions (Right-click Menus)</h3>
<p>Right-click either a PHP project or an individual file to open its context actions.
Project context actions are an easy way to access much of the IDE's functionality. 
The context actions available for a project include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>New.</b> Add a new file or folder to the project.</li>
    <li><b>Run</b></li>
    <li><b>Debug.</b> Start an XDebug session.</li>
    <li><b>Test.</b> Run PHPUnit tests.</li>
    
    <li><b>Generate PHP Doc.</b> If PHPDocumentor is configured, this action generates
    PHPDoc.</li>
    <li><b>Set Configuration.</b> Select the run configuration to use or open the Project Properties
    to create a new run configuration.</li>
    <li><b>Zend/Symfony...</b> If your project includes a framework, a menu item appears for running
    framework commands.</li>
    <li><b>Properties.</b> Opens the Project Properties, where you customize the project's settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The context menu for individual PHP files includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Save as Template...</b> You can save the file as a template and clone it in the New File wizard.</li>
    <li><b>Local history.</b> Review local changes.</li>
    <li><b>Tools.</b> Diff the file, add it to the Favorites window, or create a PHPUnit test.</li>
    
</ul>

<h3>Setting Main Projects</h3>
        
        <p>Whenever you have multiple projects open, one should always be set as the main 
            project. The main project is usually the project that contains an application's 
            main class. The IDE provides shortcut commands to quickly build, run, and debug 
            the main project. In the Projects window, the main project is shown in bold. 
            You can set any project as the main project by right-clicking its project node 
            and choosing Set as Main Project.</p>

<ul class="note">
<li>For a  view of your project that shows the actual directory structure, 
    you can use the Files window, usually available on a tab next to the Projects 
    window or by choosing Windows &gt; Files (Ctrl-2). </li>
</ul>
