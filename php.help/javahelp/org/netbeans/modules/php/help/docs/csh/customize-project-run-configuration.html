            Project Properties: Run Configuration
        </h1>

        <p>
            Run configurations accommodate the most commonly used PHP development use cases. A run
            configuration is a stored setting for running a PHP project. You can define several
            configurations for one project and switch between them. Run configurations
            apply to both running and debugging.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Project Properties Run Configuration panel contains the following fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Configuration:</b> In this field, select which existing run configuration to modify.</li>
            <li><b>New...</b> Click  to create a new run configuration. A dialog opens in
                which you name the new configuration. After you name the new configuration, the 
                new configuration is selected in the Configuration field.</li>
            <li><b>Delete</b> Click to delete the configuration selected in the Configuration field.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Run As:</b> Choose one of the following. The Run Configuration options change depending
                on which Run As choice you make.
                <ul><li>Local Web Site (running on local web server). The default option, described <a href="#runconfig-local">below</a>.</li>
                    <li><a href="runconfig-remote.html">Remote Web Site (FTP/SFTP)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="runconfig-script.html">Script (Run on command line)</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3><a name="runconfig-local"></a>Local Web Site options</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project URL:</b> By default, this is http://localhost/ + the path to the copy of your project sources
                that is in your web server's public folder. You can change the URL if you have a different path mapped to your server.</li>
            <li><b>Index File:</b> By default, this is index.php. Click <b>Browse...</b> to browse your project files for a
                different index file.</li>
            <li><b>Arguments:</b> Arguments for running the index file. For example, <tt>debug=true</tt>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Advanced.</b> Click this button if you use remote debugging or symbolic links.
                A dialog opens in which you set path mapping.</li>
        </ul>
