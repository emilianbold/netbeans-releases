    <title>New PHP Project: Run Configurations</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
       Defining the Default Run Configuration
    </h1>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
    </p>
    <p>
       Run configurations accommodate the most commonly used PHP development use cases. A run
      configuration is a stored setting for running a PHP project. You can define several
      configurations for one project and switch between them back and forth. Run configurations
      apply to both running and debugging.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Note:</strong> During the project creation, the default run configuration is
      defined. To define additional run configuration, customize your project setup.
    </p>
    <p>
       To set the default run configuration for your project, choose the relevant option from the
      Run As dropdown list. The following options are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#localWebSite">Local Web Site</a>. To use this run configuration, you need the
        Apache http server installed and running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#remoteWebSite">Remote Web Site</a> (FTP/SFTP). To use this configuration, you need a
        hosting account on a remote server and an (S)FTP account on this server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#script">Script</a>. This run configuration does not require that a web server be
        installed and running. You only need a PHP engine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
       <a name="localWebSite"></a>Local Web Site
    </h2>
    <p>
       From the Run As dropdown list, choose Local Web Site. The further procedure depends on the
      type of your project.
    </p>
    <h3>
       <a href="new-project-configure_existing_sources.html">Project without Previously Developed
      Sources</a>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Project URL field, check the automatically generated URL address. Make sure that the
        Apache HTTP server listens to the default port 80. If not, specify the port number
        explicitly:<br>
<pre>
localhost:&lt;port number&gt;
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        To have a separate storage for the project's source files, select the Copy files from
        Sources Folder to another location checkbox.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Copy to Folder field, specify the storage location.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
       <a href="new-project-configure_no_sources.html">Project with Previously Developed
      Sources</a>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select the Copy files from Sources Folder to another location checkbox.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Copy to Folder field, specify the folder on your web server where you want to store
        your source files. Use the Browse button, if necessary.<br>
         The field by default specifies the following path: <tt>&lt;Document Root&gt;\&lt;New PHP
        Project&gt;</tt>.<br>
         The document root is the folder where the web server looks for files to open in the
        browser. The document root is specified in the web server configuration file.<br>
         The wizard detects the <a href=
        "http://www.netbeans.org/kb/trails/php.html#configuration">Apache installation type</a> and
        provides the path to the default location of the <tt>htdocs</tt> folder. If you accepted
        the default settings during the installation of the Apache server or the AMP package,
        choose the relevant path from the dropdown list.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Project URL field, check the automatically generated URL address. Make sure that the
        Apache HTTP server listens to the default port 80. If not, specify the port number
        explicitly:<br>
<pre>
localhost:&lt;port number&gt;
</pre>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are using Remote Debugging or Symbolic Links, click Advanced and set up
        path mapping. See <a href="#pathmapping">Path Mapping</a>.</p>
