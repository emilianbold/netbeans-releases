            Project Properties: PHPUnit
        </h1>

        <p>In this dialog, set custom PHPUnit properties for your project.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Use bootstrap.</b> A custom bootstrap file is required for projects 
                that use a custom class loader, for example by implementing the __autoload() 
                magic function. 
                You also use the bootstrap option if you need to include a file in advance, 
                such as a file that defines global constants used by multiple classes 
                in your project.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Browse...</b> Browse your file system for the custom bootstrap
                        file.</li>
                    <li><b>Generate.</b> Click to generate a skeleton bootstrap file.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><b>Use XML Configuration.</b> The XML configuration file allows you 
                to define options that you use in a command line call. There 
                is a complete introduction in the PHPUnit manual. You can also use the 
                XML configuration file to define php.ini settings and global vars for 
                your test cases. You can set the bootstrap option in the XML configuration 
                file too.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Browse...</b> Browse your file system for the custom bootstrap
                        file.</li>
                    <li><b>Generate.</b> Click to generate a skeleton XML Configuration file.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><b>Use Custom Test Suite.</b> If you set a custom test suite, you run that 
                suite whenever you select Run >Test Project. This is particularly useful 
                when you wish to run only a subset of your tests, or if you want to use 
                recently added features of PHPUnit that you have to add manually, such as 
                Data Providers.
                <p>Note that you may define as many test suites as you 
                    want and run them separately. To run a test suite, right-click the test 
                    suite file in your project explorer and choose "run".</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Browse...</b> Browse your file system for the custom bootstrap
                        file.</li>
                    <li><b>Generate.</b> Click to generate a skeleton test suite.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
