        <h2>
            PHP Formatting
        </h2>
        <p>This page describes the options in both Options: Editor: Formatting and Project Properties: Formatting if you select the PHP language. Options: Editor: Formatting sets global options 
            whereas Project Properties: Formatting sets project-specific options. </p>

        <h3>The Preview Window</h3>
        <p>The Preview window contains sample code that reflects changes you make in Formatting.</p>
        <h3>Categories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#tabs-indents">Tabs and Indents</a></li>
            <li><a href="#alignment">Alignment</a></li>
            <li><a href="#braces">Braces</a></li>
            <li><a href="#blank-lines">Blank Lines</a></li>
            <li><a href="#spaces">Spaces</a></li>
            <li><a href="#wrapping">Wrapping</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="tabs-indents"></a>Tabs and Indents</h3>

        <ul><li><b>Use All Languages Settings. </b> Unselect to override the 
                All Languages settings. Unselecting Use All Languages Settings enables the following fields:
                <ul>

                    <li><b>Expand Tabs to Spaces.</b> When selected, inserts spaces when the Tab key is typed.
                        <!--The number of spaces inserted is set in the Number of Spaces per Indent property.-->
                        When unselected, typing the Tab key inserts the tab character (<tt>\t</tt>) into the file if 
                        possible. It also replaces preceding spaces with the tab character if possible.  
                        The Source Editor calculates where to place tab characters based on the value 
                        of the Tab Size property.
                        <p>If Expand Tabs to Spaces is unselected and the Number of Spaces per Indent is different
                            than the Tab Size property, the indentation created by typing the Tab key is 
                            made up of a combination of spaces and tab characters.  It is easiest to predict 
                            the location of tab characters if you set Number of Spaces per Indent to an even
                            multiple or divisor of Tab Size.</p>
                        <ul class="note"><li><b>Important:</b> This feature does not convert
                                existing tabs to spaces. Only tabs that you add <i>after</i> you
                                enable this option are converted.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Indent:</b> Number of spaces per indentation level for subelements, new lines inside
                        brackets, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Tab size:</b>See the description of Expand Tabs to Spaces, above.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Right margin:</b> Position of the vertical red line that indicates the right margin.
                    </li>     
                    <li><b>Line wrap:</b> Whether lines are wrapped when they are longer than the width of the Editor window (no relationship to right margin). Options are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Off.</b> No line wrapping (default).</li>
                            <li><b>After words.</b> Words are not broken by line wrapping.</li>
                            <li><b>Anywhere.</b> Lines are broken in the middle of words by line wrapping.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>See also <a href="#wrapping">Wrapping</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Initial Indentation:</b> Indentation of the first line of
                the PHP code block, after the initial &lt;? tag.</li>
            <li><b>Continuation Indentation:</b> If you place a line break in a code statement, this is how
                far the IDE indents the continuation of the code statement after the line break.</li>
            <li><b>Array Declaration Indentation.</b> If you place a line break in an array declaration,
                this is how far the IDE indents the continuation of the array declaration after the line break.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Tab and Indent settings and see the results in the Preview window.</li></ul>
        <h3><a name="alignment"></a>Alignment</h3>
        <p>Specify which elements should be aligned after a line break.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>New lines.</b> The IDE breaks lines before any elements you select here.</li>
            <li><b>Multiline Alignment.</b> Use if you set lines to wrap automatically at an element and
                you want that element to be aligned vertically. First turn <a href="#wrapping">wrapping</a> on           
                for the element and then select the element in this dialog.
                <ul class="note"><li>Requires <a href="#wrapping">Wrapping</a> to be turned on for the same element.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Alignment settings and see the results in the Preview window.
            You can only preview Multiline Alignment for an element if you have turned Wrapping on for the same element.</li></ul>
        <h3><a name="braces"></a>Braces</h3>
        <p>Select where to place the braces for each type of statement listed in this dialog. Use the Format
            function (Alt+Shift+F) to apply the Braces settings to a PHP document.
            The possible brace locations are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Same line</li>
            <li>New line</li>
            <li>New line indented</li>
            <li>Preserve existing</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Braces settings and see the results in the Preview window.</li></ul>
        <h3><a name="blank-lines"></a>Blank Lines</h3>    
        <p>Improves readability by setting off sections of code that are logically related according to the specified options. Select the number of blank lines to place in the listed positions. For example, "After Fields:
            1" places 1 blank line after every field.</p>
        <p>You also have the option to Group Fields Without PHP Doc. This is selected by default. When
            you select this option, there are no blank lines between fields that do not have PHPDoc documentation.</p>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Blank Lines settings and see the results in the Preview window.</li></ul>
        <h3><a name="spaces"></a>Spaces</h3>
        <p>In this panel, set where the IDE automatically puts whitespaces. Due to the large number
            of possible places to put whitespaces, the places to put whitespaces are displayed in a tree
            of categories. 
            Expand a tree node to see the places under a category, or
            collapse a node to hide the places under a category. The categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Before Keywords (example: "while")</li>
            <li>Before Parentheses (example: "for (")</li>
            <li>Around Operators (example: binary operators)</li>
            <li>Before Left Braces (example: Class declarations, "class Example {")</li>
            <li>Within Parentheses (example: "if ( convert...")</li>
            <li>Other (example: After Commas)</li>               
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Spaces settings and see the results in the Preview window.</li></ul>
        <h3><a name="wrapping"></a>Wrapping</h3>
        <p>In this panel set the rules for the IDE to wrap lines automatically. The panel lists the 
            possible elements before which the IDE wraps lines. For each element you can have the IDE never
            wrap lines, always wrap lines, or wrap lines if the statement is long (wider than the Editor window).</p>
        <p>You can also have the IDE automatically wrap lines after opening and before closing block
            braces, and between statements that are typed on the same line. Both of these options are enabled
            by default.</p>
        <ul class="note"><li>You can experiment with different Wrapping settings and see the results in the Preview window.</li>
            <li>See also the Line Wrap option in <a href="#tabs-indents">Tabs and Indents</a>.</li>
            <li>You can set the wrapped lines to align horizontally, by element. See the Multiline Alignment
                section of <a href="#alignment">Alignment</a>.</li>
