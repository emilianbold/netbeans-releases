When absent, the file transfer will not use remote file handler; When present, the file transfer will use remote file handler, before the file transfer starts you need to start the remote file handler process with specified Transfer EndPoint name on your system. The command to start remote file handler (swfa_handler) takes command-line arguments as follows:\n\
\n\
 swfa_handler <HostName>:<PortNumber>[:ssl] <TransferEndpoint> [<Process ID>] \n\
\n\
Here are some examples: \n\
\n\
swfa_handler snlhost:48003:ssl MyUniqueEndpoint 23450 \n\

\n\
swfa_handler snlhost:48003 MyUniqueEndpoint \n\
\n\

DESC_Element_ConnectionEstablishment=Defines configuration parameters used for controlling the connection establishment.
DESC_Attribute_TimeToWaitBeforeAttemptingConnection=This parameter specifies the length of time (in milli-seconds) that the eWay waits before attempting to connect to the external system.
DESC_Attribute_MaxConnectionRetries=The maximum number of times the eWay will attempt to connect to the specified external SAG destination before giving up.
DESC_Attribute_RetryConnectionInterval=The number of milli-seconds to wait between attempts to connect to the specified external SAG destination.
DESC_Attribute_AlwaysCreateNewConnection=This flag indicates whether to ALWAYS try to create a new connection for a connection establishment request. If it is false, an attempt to match an existing connection (managed by container) is made; if it is true, a new connection is always created without trying to match an existing connection.
DESC_Attribute_AutoReconnectUponMatchingFailure=Whether attempt to re-connect automatically after getting a matched connection from a container, but this connection is not valid due to different reasons. For example, the external side of the connection was closed/reset upon the external application's logic. A value of 'true' means that we will discard the invalid matched connection and try to re-establish a new connection automatically. A value of 'false' means that we won't try to re-establish a new connection automatically. Instead, we will simply leave/defer the control to users' business rules, which should detect this kind of failure and perform the desired operations.
DESC_Attribute_AutoDisconnectConnection=This flag indicates whether the eWay disconnects the connection automatically after the work finishes on the connection. If it is false, the connection will be returned back to pool for reuse; if it is true, the connection will not be re-used.
DESC_Attribute_EarlyConnectUponDeployment=This flag indicates whether the eWay will connect upon request or whether it will connect early. That is, the eWay can establish the connection either upon connection-request or deployment. If set to false, the eWay will try to connect to an external EIS only when some component requests the connection, which is a regular J2EE case; if set to true, the eWay will try to connect to an external EIS immediately after the project is deployed. Unless your use case requires this parameter to be modified, it is recommended that you keep the default setting,  which is false.
DESC_Element_environment-configuration=Environment Configuration of this Managed Connection Factory
DESC_Element_Transport=Transport
DESC_Attribute_ReadFromRaCfgFile=We can get RA transport information (i.e. Host Name, Port Number, etc) in two ways: \n\
\n\
1. Read them from an existing RA configuration file (for example, "sagta_ra.cfg") for your SAG RA environment. Probably this is the easiest way for most cases. \n\
\n\
2. Get them from e*Way configuration parameters defined in the rest of this section. \n\
\n\
If this parameter is specified with a value, that means you are choosing the first way, and the value of this parameter gives RA configuration file name (for example, "sagta_ra.cfg"), the other parameters (i.e. "Host Name", "Port Number", etc) in this section will be ignored. \n\
\n\
If this parameter is not specified, that means you are choosing the second way, the other parameters (i.e. "Host Name", "Port Number", etc) in this section should be specified and will be used.
DESC_Attribute_HostName=The name of the SAG host or its IP address. It is required if the previous configuration parameter ("Read From RA CFG File") is not specified.
DESC_Attribute_PortNumber=The number of the port on the SAG host to which RA connects.
DESC_Attribute_FtlaPortNumber=The number of the port on the SAG host through which File Transfers will take place.
DESC_Attribute_ServerDN=The Distinguished Name, used for SWIFTAlliance Gateway authentication.
DESC_Attribute_CACertificate=The file that contains the Certification Authority certificate.
DESC_Attribute_SSLMode=True or False depending upon whether data encryption is to be used.
DESC_Attribute_Reconnect=Reconnect
DESC_Attribute_HBInterval=Heartbeat Interval
DESC_Attribute_HBLimit=Heartbeat Limit
DESC_Attribute_DisplayName=Display Name
DESC_Element_ConnectionPoolSettings=Connection Pool Settings. It is specific for RA connection pool of Sun Java System Application Server (Sun One Application Server) or Sun SeeBeyond Integration Server only. The parameter settings in this section will go into sun-ra.xml. Please refer to the corresponding documentations along with your product for more details.
DESC_Attribute_SteadyPoolSize=It maps to parameter steady-pool-size in sun-ra.xml which is specific for Sun Java System Application Server (Sun One Application Server) or Sun SeeBeyond Integration Server, see the corresponding documentations for more information. It represents the minimum number of RA connections to be maintained. When it is set to greater than 0, the container not only pre-populates the RA connection pool with the specified number, but also attempts to ensure that there is always this many RA connections in the free pool. This ensures that there are enough RA connections in the ready to serve state to process user requests. This parameter does not necessarily guarantee that no more than steady-pool-size instances exist at a given time. It only governs the number of instances that are pooled over a long period of time. For example, suppose an idle stateless session container has a fully-populated pool with a steady-pool-size of 10. If 20 concurrent requests arrive for the RA connection component, the container creates 10 additional instances to satisfy the burst of requests. The advantage of this is that it prevents the container from blocking any of the incoming requests. However, if the activity dies down to 10 or fewer concurrent requests, the additional 10 instances are discarded.
DESC_Attribute_MaxPoolSize=It maps to parameter max-pool-size in sun-ra.xml which is specific for Sun Java System Application Server (Sun One Application Server) or Sun SeeBeyond Integration Server, see the correspondings documentations for more information. It represents the maximum number of RA connections in the pool. A value of 0 means the pool is unbounded.
DESC_Attribute_MaxWaitTimeInMillis=It maps to parameter max-wait-time-in-millis in sun-ra.xml which is specific for Sun Java System Application Server (Sun One Application Server) or Sun SeeBeyond Integration Server, see the corresponding documentations for more information. If a RA connection is not available, the caller will have to wait this long, before a RA connection is created. A value of 0 implies, if there is no RA connection available an exception will be thrown. If the pool is completely utilized and the timer expires, an exception will be delivered to the application. Note: This element is deprecated for bean pool container for newer Sun Java System Application Server.
DESC_Attribute_PoolIdleTimeoutInSeconds=It maps to parameter pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds in sun-ra.xml which is specific for Sun Java System Application Server (Sun One Application Server) or Sun SeeBeyond Integration Server, see the corresponding documentations for more information. This is a hint to the server. A timer thread periodically removes unused RA connections. This parameter defines the interval at which this thread runs. This thread removes unused RA connection that their timeout has expired. It allows the user to specify, through the amount of time a RA connection instance can be idle in the pool. When pool-idle-timeout-in-seconds is set to greater than 0,  the container removes or destroys any RA connection instance that is idle for this specified duration. It is the maximum time that a component can remain idle in the pool. After this amount of time, the pool can remove this bean. A value of 0 specifies that idle RA connections can remain in the pool indefinitely.
