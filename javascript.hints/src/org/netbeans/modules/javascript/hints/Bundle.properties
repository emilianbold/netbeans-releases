 in literals. Use the \\u escape sequence instead.

#AccidentalAssignment=Test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
AccidentalAssignment=Accidental assignment? (if x = y instead of x == y)
AccidentalAssignmentDesc=Detects the scenario where an assignment is used as a boolean expression in \
 an if block, usually accidentally. For example, \n\
   x = 1\n\
   y = 2\n\
   if (x = y) { alert("equal") }\n\
will always display "equal" because x = y assigns rather than just compares.
AccidentalAssignmentFix=Convert assignment to comparison (change = to ==)
AccidentalAssignmentIgnore=Add extra ()'s to indicate that this is intentional
