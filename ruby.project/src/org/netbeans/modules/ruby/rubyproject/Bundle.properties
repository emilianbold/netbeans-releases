# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: COMMENT_* keys are used to create the initial project.properties
# for a project. The properties file format only accepts ISO-8859-1 characters in their
# raw form, i.e. Western European scripts. Any other characters (e.g. Asian) will be stored
# in the properties file correctly but be unreadable in text mode: \u1234 syntax is used.
# (The proper characters will be displayed only if the file is opened in the table editor.)
