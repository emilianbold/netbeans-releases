/**
 * A proxy for another UndoRedo.Manager instance which removes and then
 * adds the undoable edit listeners from a Swing document, each time the
 * undo and redo operations are invoked. Essentially, this allows the
 * client to avoid firing undo events to the listeners when doing nothing
 * more than undoing or redoing a change to the document.
 *
 * <p>To use this undo manager proxy with <code>CloneableEditorSupport</code>,
 * it is necessary to subclass <code>CloneableEditorSupport</code> and override
 * the <code>createUndoRedoManager()</code> method to return an instance of
 * this class, providing the return value of
 * <code>super.createUndoRedoManager()</code> to the
 * <code>QuietUndoManager</code> constructor. In this way, this proxy can
 * then intercept all new edits and properly manage its state. Note that
 * setting the document in <code>createUndoRedoManager()</code> will not be
 * possible since the document will not have been initialized yet. It will
 * have to happen at a later time.</p>
