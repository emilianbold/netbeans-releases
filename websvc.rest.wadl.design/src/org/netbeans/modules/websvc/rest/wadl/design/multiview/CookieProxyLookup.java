 * A ProxyLookup that changes the last delegate lookup to not return instances

 * delegate, which presumably provides cookies such as SaveCookie. But we
 * do not want the Node delegate to return instances of Node via its Lookup
 * (specifically the Node delegate itself).
 *
 * <p>Usage, from within a <code>TopComponent</code> constructor:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * CookieProxyLookup cpl = new CookieProxyLookup(new Lookup[] {
 *     lookup1,
 *     lookup2,
 *     // The Node delegate Lookup must be the last one in the list
 *     // for the CookieProxyLookup to work properly.
 *     delegate.getLookup(),
 * }, delegate);
