        <h2>Editing a Cascading Style Sheet</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>When editing CSS files, you can take advantage of typical Source Editor features,
            including indentation, syntax coloring, and standard clipboard commands. NetBeans
            IDE also provides a CSS Style Builder and a Preview window. Use these features 
            together to experiment with different styles.</p>

        <h4>To open a CSS file in the Source Editor:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the CSS file's node (<img src="../images/css.gif" alt="CSS node icon image">) in the Files window.  
            <li>Choose Edit from the pop-up menu. 
                <p>The IDE opens the CSS file in a new Source Editor
                    tab and shifts focus to it. Alternately, you can also simply double-click
                    the file's node in the Files window. 
        </ol>
        <h3>CSS Style Builder</h3>
        <p>To open the Style Builder, go to Window &gt; Other &gt; CSS Style Builder. The Style Builder opens below the Editor window.</p>
        <p>To use the Style Builder, go to the Editor window and place your cursor 
            in the element whose style you want to define. A set of tabs appear in the Style
            Builder. The tabs correspond to style categories, such as Font and Background. 
            Select a tab and select style settings in that tab. For example, to set the font
            of the &lt;h2&gt; element as Verdana, find <span style="color:green"><b>h2</b></span>
            in the Editor, open the Font tab in the Style builder, and select "Verdana, Arial, Helvetica,
            sans-serif" in the list of fonts.  
        </p>
        <h3>Preview Window</h3>
        <p>The IDE provides a Preview window in which you can preview what HTML elements
            look like according to your CSS. By default, the Preview window appears below and to 
            the right of the Editor window when you open a CSS file. If the Preview window is
            closed, open it by going to Window &gt; Other &gt; CSS Preview.</p>
        <p>The Preview window requires a CSS Previewer plugin. The NetBeans Update Center
            includes one CSS Previewer, the Flying Saucer Renderer. To install Flying Saucer,
            go to Tools &gt; Plugins, open the Available Plugins tab, and find the CSS Preview
            Flying Saucer plugin.</p>
        <p>To use the Preview window, select a CSS element in the Editor window. If the previewer
            can render the element, sample text in that style appears in the Preview window.</p>
