<p> The IDE enables you to  configure Source Editor behaviour
  when editing XML and DTD files. </p>
<h3>Editing XML and DTD Properties</h3>
<p> To access DTD Editor or XML Editor  properties: 
<ol>
  <li>Choose Tools  &gt; Options.
  <li>In the Options window, expand
  Editing &gt; Editor
  Settings.
  <li>Select the DTD Editor
        or XML Editor node.
</ol>
   
<h3>XML and DTD Property Descriptions</h3>
<p>The IDE's XML and DTD editor properties are organized into two groups based
	on their relative complexity.
<h3> Properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Abbreviations.</b>&nbsp; Specifies abbreviations for terms that you want 
    the editor to expand automatically. Click the ellipsis (...) button to edit 
    abbreviations. </li>
  <li><b>Fonts and Colors.</b>&nbsp; Sets background and foreground colors and
    fonts for various syntax tokens and other elements displayed in the Source
    Editor, such as bookmarked lines, comments, guarded blocks. Click the ellipsis
    (...) button to edit the properties.
    
  </li>
  <li><b>Auto Popup Completion Window</b> (XML only).&nbsp; If True, enables
    the editor to display a code completion box with options for how to complete
    an expression. 
    <p> This property applies only to editor types that support code completion, 
      such as Java, HTML, and JSP. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Delay of Completion Window Auto Popup</b> (XML only).&nbsp; If the Auto Popup
    Completion  Window property is True, sets the number of milliseconds between
    the time  when typing stops and the time when the code completion box is
  displayed. </li>
  <li><b>Code Completion Instant Substitution</b> (XML only). If true, invocation
    of code completion performs instant substitution when search  returns
    only one  item. </li>
  <li><b>Font Size.</b>&nbsp; Sets the font to the specified size for all tokens 
    that are not given distinct values in the Fonts and Colors property. </li>
  <li><b>Indentation Engine.</b>&nbsp; Specifies how you want to handle text formatting, 
    including settings for tabs, spaces, and new lines. Click the ellipsis (...) 
    button to edit the possible indentation engine choices. 
    
  </li>
  <li><b>Line Numbers.</b>&nbsp; If True, adds line numbers in the left margin. 
    You can also toggle line numbers by choosing Margin  &gt; Show 
    Line Numbers from the pop-up menu in the Source Editor. </li>
  <li><b>Macros.</b>&nbsp; Edits, adds, and removes Source Editor macros. Click 
    the ellipsis (...) button to modify existing macros. 
    <p> It is generally easier to add a new macro by recording it than by manually 
      adding one in the Macros property editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Tab Size.</b>&nbsp; Sets the number of spaces inserted per tab character 
    (\t) when a file is imported. This is set as 8 by default for compliance with 
    many other applications. 
    <p> You can also specify tab settings for text that is typed, generated, or 
      formatted in the Source Editor using the Indentation Engine property described 
      above. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Expert  Properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Insertion Point Blink Rate.</b>&nbsp; Sets blink rate (in milliseconds)
    for the text pointer that marks the insertion point. </li>
  <li><b>Insertion Point Color.</b>&nbsp; Specifies the color of the caret when
    in insert mode. Select a color from the list or display the custom property
    editor for colors by clicking the ellipsis (...) button. </li>
  <li><b>Overwrite Caret Color.</b>&nbsp; Specifies the caret color when in overwrite
  mode. </li>

<li><b>Insertion Point.</b>&nbsp; Determines the type of caret that appears at
  the insertion point when in insert mode. From the list you can select Vertical
  bar, Thin vertical bar, or Solid block. </li>
<li><b>Overwrite Caret.</b>&nbsp; Determines the type of caret that appears when
  in overwrite mode. From the list you can select line, thin line, or block. </li>
<li><b>Highlight Caret Row.</b>&nbsp;
If True, highlights the row where the insertion point (caret) is. 
</li>

<li><b>Highlight Matching Bracket.</b>&nbsp;
If True, the matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis highlights 
whenever the insertion point is immediately after a brace, bracket, 
or parenthesis. </li>

<li><b>Line Height Correction.</b>&nbsp; Adjusts height of lines by specified
  multiplier. </li>
<li> <b>Margin.</b>&nbsp; Sets top, bottom, left, and right margins of text within
  the Source Editor page. The left margin determines how far text starts to the
  left of the glyph margin. Click the ellipsis (...) button to edit the settings. </li>
<li><b>Scroll Find Insets.</b>&nbsp; Specifies how much space should be reserved
  on each side of text located with the Find command. </li>
<li><b>Scroll Jump Insets.</b>&nbsp; For each of four directions, specifies how
  much the view should jump when the scrolling goes off the screen. </li>
<li><b>Status Bar Caret Delay.</b>&nbsp; Sets the delay (in milliseconds) between
  the time when the caret stops moving and the update of its position in the
  status bar. </li>
<li><b>Status Bar Visible.</b>&nbsp; If True, displays the status bar (which
  shows information such as current line number and whether the editor is in
  insert or overwrite mode) at the bottom of the window. </li>
<li><b>Text Limit Line Color.</b>&nbsp; Specifies the color of the text limit
  line. </li>
<li><b>Display Text Limit Line.</b>&nbsp; If True, shows a vertical line to mark
  suggested maximum line width (for example, for printing). </li>
<li><b>Text Limit Character Count.</b>&nbsp; Sets the number of characters to
  the right of the left margin where the text limit line is displayed. </li>
</ul>


<!--
  <li><b>Italic Insertion Point.</b>&nbsp;
    If True, displays italic insertion point (caret) when in insert mode. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Italic Overwrite Caret.</b>&nbsp;
    If True, displays italic insertion point (caret) when in overwrite mode. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Line Number Margin.</b>&nbsp;
    Determines placement of line numbers within the glyph margin.  
    <p>
    Line numbers are aligned to the right. 
    The left margin determines the distance from the left edge of the window 
    based on the highest line number.  Therefore, the left margin will look 
    larger at the top of the page, where line numbers have fewer digits. 
    </p>
