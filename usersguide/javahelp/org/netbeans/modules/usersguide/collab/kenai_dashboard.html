        <h2>Using the Team Dashboard</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>The Team Dashboard enables you to quickly view information
        about Team projects that you have joined or opened.
        If you are logged in to a Team Server, the projects that you
        have joined are automatically listed in the Team Dashboard.
        </p>

        <p><strong>To open the Team Dashboard:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Team Dashboard from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>
        You can join projects that you are interested in by bookmarking the project on the Team Server site.
        If a project is listed under your Open Projects in the Team window, you can click the Bookmark icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/bookmark.png">&nbsp;)
        for the project to bookmark the project and add the project to the list of My Projects.
        When you log in to a Team Server in the IDE, all the projects that you have joined are listed under My Projects in the Team Dashboard.
        My Projects provides an overview that enables you to monitor and
        access each project's issues (&nbsp;<img src="../images/kenai-bug.png">&nbsp;) and messages (&nbsp;<img src="../images/chat-newmessage.png">&nbsp;).
        To view more details about a specific project, click the Open Project icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/kenai-dash-open.png">&nbsp;)
        to add the project to the list under Open Projects.
        </p>


        <h3>Open Projects</h3>
        <p>
        You can view additional details about a Team project by opening the project in the Team Dashboard.
        When you open a project, a node for the project is displayed under Open Projects.
        If you joined the project by bookmarking the project, the name is displayed in bold.
        Opening a project in the Team Dashboard does not automatically bookmark the project.
        </p>
        <p>You can open a project in the following ways.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking the Open Project icon of a project under My Projects in the Team Dashboard</li>
            <li>Opening a project using the Open Team Project dialog box.
            To open the dialog box, choose Team &gt; Team Server &gt; Open Team Project from the main menu.
            Alternatively, click the Open Team Project icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/open_kenai_project.png">&nbsp;) at the top of the Team Dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To remove a project from the list of Open Projects,
        click the project's Close icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/close-kenai-project.png">&nbsp;).</p>

        <p>You can expand a project listed under Open Projects to view the following details.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chat Messages.</strong>
            The total number of new messages in the project's chat room is displayed next to the
            the Mesage icon (&nbsp;<img src="../images/chat-newmessage.png">&nbsp;).

            mailing list archives, forums and repository changes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Members.</strong>
            The Members node enables you to view a list of project members
            and see which members are online.
            You can double-click the name of a member to initiate a private chat.</li>
            <li><strong>Issues.</strong>
            The Issues node enables you to quickly view and submit project issues.
            You can work with issues directly in the IDE.
            For example, you can click New issue to open the New Issue tab
            in the main window and submit an issue.</li>
