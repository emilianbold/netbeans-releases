        <p>After you register an issue tracking system with the IDE,
        you can perform most common issues-related tasks from within the IDE.
        If you are using an issue tracking system provided by Kenai, the issue tracker
        is already registered with the IDE and associated with a project.
        You can also <a href="issues_external.html">register an external tracker</a> in the Services window.
        </p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you are working on a project on Kenai,
            you can use the Team Dashboard to work with project issues.
