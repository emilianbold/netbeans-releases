<h2>Accessing Files Outside of a Project</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>When developing applications, you must create a project within which
	to house your source code and related files. If you need to access a file
	outside of your projects, you can do so using the Favorites window. </p>
<p><b>To access a file or folder outside of an IDE project:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Window &gt; Favorites 
    (Ctrl-3).</li>
  <li>Right-click in the Favorites wndow and choose Add to Favorites.</li>
  <li>Select the folder that you want to access and click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the Favorites window enables you to open and edit source files 
  from anywhere on your system, the IDE knows nothing about the classpath and 
  other project settings belonging to those source files. You therefore cannot 
  run, compile, or debug any Java source files from the Favorites window. </p>
<p>You can, however, run Ant scripts that do not belong to any project from the 
  Favorites window. You can also use the Favorites window to access an Ant script 
  and create a shortcut to the targets in that Ant script.</p>
