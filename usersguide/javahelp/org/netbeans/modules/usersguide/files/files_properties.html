<h2>Properties Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Most elements that can be represented by nodes in the Projects, Files, or Navigator
	windows have properties that can be viewed in a property sheet. The Properties
	window displays the property sheet for a selected element. Elements with properties include:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Java and PHP classes</li>
    <li>Swing and JavaFX GUI elements</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>HTML files</li>
</ul>
<p>To open the Properties window, choose Window  &gt; Properties or Ctrl-Shift-7.</p>

<p>Select the node or element in the Projects, Navigator, or Files window, or in the Visual Debugger or Swing Design editor for JavaFX and Java GUIs.The Properties window displays the names and values of the properties of the currently selected node or element.  Depending on the type of object selected, you might see additional tabs for distinct categories of 
properties. </p>

<h3>Editing Properties in the Properties window</h3>
<p>You can edit the values of most properties in the Properties window. 
To change a property value, click the property's value field. The appearance 
of the field changes depending on the type of value required:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a string value is required, the field becomes a text field. You can type the new value directly in 
this field and press Enter.</li>
<li>If a specific list of values is allowed, a drop-down arrow appears. You can click this arrow and 
select the value from the combo box that appears. You can also double-click the property name to 
rotate through the available values.</li>
<li>If a property editor is available for that property, an ellipsis (...) button appears. You 
can click the ellipsis button to open the property editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Node Properties Sheets in the IDE </h3>
<p>You can display property sheets for selected nodes in the  IDE's various 
	windows,  such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Debugger window</li>
<li>The GUI Builder</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>You can also open  Properties dialog boxes that are dedicated to a particular
	nodes by right-clicking the node and choosing Properties from the pop-up
