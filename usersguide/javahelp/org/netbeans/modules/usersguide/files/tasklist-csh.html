    <h2>Task List Window</h2>
    <p>The Task List window (known as the To Do window in previous versions of the 
        IDE) displays a unified list of things that you need to 
    resolve in your various files.</p>
    <p>You can click on an entries in 
        the Task List window to jump to the line of the file where 
    the task needs to be resolved.</p>
    <p>Task List window entries are created by some types of errors and by 
    the occurrence of specific character patterns in the file.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the things that create task list entries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code comments that contain the patterns <tt>TODO</tt>, <tt>XXX</tt>, or <tt>FIXME</tt></li>
        <li>The pattern <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt>, which denotes merge conflicts in CVS and other 
        version control systems</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) Javadoc comments that contain the <tt>@todo</tt> keyword</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) lines where compiler errors are registered</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can do the following in the Task List window:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jump to a To Do task in the Source Editor.</li>
        <li>Sort and filter the list of To Do tasks displayed in the window.</li>
        <li>Create and modify To Do task filters.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To open the To Do window, choose Window &gt; Task List (Ctrl-6) from the main menu.
        The Task List displays found TODO tasks.
        You can sort the list of tasks by clicking the column heading of the Task List.
    The To Do toolbar above the Task List enables you to modify and work with the displayed TODO tasks.</p>



    
    <h3>Task List Window Toolbar</h3>
    <p>Use the following items in the Task List window toolbar to specify which files are scanned for tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current File.</b> When selected, the IDE scans the file that is currently selected in the Source Editor and displays the To Do tasks found in that file. When you open a new file in the editor, the file is scanned and only the To Do tasks in that file are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Main project and dependent projects.</b> When selected, the IDE scans all files open in the Source Editor and displays all To Do tasks in the open files. When you open a file in the editor, the file is scanned and the To Do tasks in that file are added to the list of displayed tasks.</li>
        <li><b>All opened projects.</b> Choose a folder from the drop-down list to scan that folder for To Do tasks. Use the Refresh button (<img src="images/todo_refresh.png">) to refresh the list.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Use the following items in the To Do window toolbar to modify the list of displayed tasks and work with the listed To Do items.</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column contains the graphic icon for the function in the To Do window toolbar. 
    The right column contains a description of the function.">
        <tr>
            <td><b>Icon</b></td>
            <td><b>Description</b></td>
        </tr>     
        <tr>

            <td><b>Show selected TODO in editor.</b> Select a TODO task from the task list and click this button to show the location of the task in the Source Editor.</td>

            <td><img src="images/todo_filter.png" alt="Edit Filters"></td>
            <td><b>Edit filters.</b> Click this button to open the Edit Filters dialog box.
                The Edit Filters dialog box enables you to add and modify the filters used to filter the TODO tasks displayed in the To Do window.
