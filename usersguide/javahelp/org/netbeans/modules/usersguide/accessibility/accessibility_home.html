<h2>About Accessibility</h2>
<p>
The IDE provides many accessibility features that enable you to read about and use the product in the manner that is most comfortable and convenient to you.
</p>
<H3>Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>
<P>
The IDE provides keyboard shortcuts for most actions. To see the available keyboard shortcuts, and edit them if you want, choose Tools  &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. For information on changing or adding keyboard shortcuts, see <a href="../shortcuts/editorcuts.html">Editor Shortcuts</a> and 
<a href="../shortcuts/menucuts.html">Menu Shortcuts</a>.
For information on the keystrokes needed to navigate through the help 
viewer, see <a href="../shortcuts/jhshortcuts.html">Help Viewer Shortcuts</a>.
</p>
<H3>Mnemonics</H3>
<P>
The IDE provides mnemonics throughout the application.  A mnemonic
is an underlined letter that shows you which key to press
in conjunction with the Alt key to activate a command or navigate
to a component.
</p>
<h3>Fonts and Colors</h3>
<P>
You can set the font size of the IDE user interface in
the <i>IDE-HOME</i><tt>/etc/netbeans.conf</tt> file.  For instructions, see <a href="../configure/configure_startup-switches.html">IDE Startup Parameters</a>.
</p><p>
You can also set individual font and color properties for the Source Editor, Diff viewer, and  <a href="stylesheet.html">Help viewer</a>.
</p>
<h3>Code Completion</h3>
<P>
The IDE has a dynamic code completion feature for the Java editor,
HTML editor, and JSP editor. This feature enables you to type a few characters and then display a list of possible matches that can be used to automatically complete the expression.
</P>
<h3>Menus and Toolbars</h3>
<P>
You can customize the menus and toolbars in the IDE by adding and removing
commands.  For more information on these features, see <a href="../configure/workspace/menu_commands.html">Customizing the Display of Commands in a Menu</a> and <a href="../configure/workspace/toolbar_commands.html">Customizing the Display of Commands in a Toolbar</a>.
</P>
<H3>Web Browsers</H3>
<P>
The IDE is integrated with an HTML browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.  You can use this browser to view the online help.
For information, see <a href="alternate_browser.html">Displaying Help in a Web Browser</a>.
