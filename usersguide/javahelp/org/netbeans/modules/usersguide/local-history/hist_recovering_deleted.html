        <h2>Recovering Deleted Files</h2>

        <p>The IDE's local history repository maintains previous versions of your project 
            sources. This includes files or folders which you have recently deleted. 
            Sometimes when developing you may find it useful to be able to reexamine 
            and possibly reinstate previously deleted files into your project. You 
            can take advantage of the IDE's local history tools to recover previously 
            deleted files.</p>
        
        <p>If you have previously deleted files and they are still maintained in the IDE's 
            local history repository, you can invoke the Revert Deleted command to retrieve 
            them:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>From the Projects, Files, or Favorites window, select the project or 
                directory that previously contained the files which you deleted and choose 
                either:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Local History &gt; Revert Deleted from the right-click menu.</li>
                    <li>Versioning &gt; Local History &gt Revert Deleted from the IDE's main menu.</li>
                </ul>
            
                The previously deleted files reappear beneath the project or folder you selected.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>In order to recover deleted files using the Revert Deleted command, files must
                not be created or deleted externally.</li>
        </ul>
