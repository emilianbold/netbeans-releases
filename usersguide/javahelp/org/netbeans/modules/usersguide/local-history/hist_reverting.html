        <h2>Reverting a File to a Previous Version</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's local history functionality enables you to revert your current file 
            to a previous version.</p>
        
        <p>There are two ways to revert a file's current version to any previously stored 
            version:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>If you already know the version you want to revert to, select your file 
                (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and choose Local 
                History &gt; Revert to. The <a href="csh/hist_revert_dialog.html">Revert 
                To dialog</a> opens, enabling you to select a version from the provided table.</li>
            <li>If you want to view a version prior to selecting it, open the IDE's graphical 
                Diff Viewer:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Local History &gt; Show Local History from a file's right-click 
                        menu. The graphical <a href="csh/hist_diff_viewer.html">Diff Viewer</a> 
                        opens.</li>
                    <li>Select a version from the table displayed in the upper area of the viewer.
                        The selected version displays on the left side in the Diff Viewer below 
                        and is compared against your current version.</li>
                    <li>After examining differences between the two versions, you can use the icons 
                        displayed in the Diff Viewer to make changes:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><img src="images/insert.png" alt="insert icon">: Inserts the highlighted 
                                text from the previous revision into the current revision.</li>
                            <li><img src="images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">: Removes the highlighted 
                                text from the current version so that it mirrors the previous version.</li>
                            <li><img src="images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">: Reverts the file's 
                                current version to the state of the selected previous version.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can make changes to your current version directly in the graphical Diff Viewer. To do
                so, place the cursor directly in the Current Version pane and edit where appropriate. The
                current version is instantaneously updated to reflect changes.</li>
        </ul>
