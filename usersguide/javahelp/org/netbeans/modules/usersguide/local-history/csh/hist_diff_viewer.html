        <h2>Local History: Diff Viewer</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Diff Viewer enables you to compare different
            versions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the
            differences between the files being compared.</p>
            
        <p>The Previous (<img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">) 
            and Next (<img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">) 
            Difference buttons in the toolbar allow you to navigate among differences found 
            between versions in the file.</p>
            
        <p>The Diff Viewer highlights changes in the files using the following colors:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><font color="blue">Blue</font>. Indicates lines that have been changed since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
            <li><font color="green">Green</font>. Indicates lines that have been added since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
            <li><font color="red">Red</font>. Indicates lines that have been removed since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The following icons allow you to make changes directly within the Diff Viewer:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><img src="../images/insert.png" alt="insert icon">: Inserts the highlighted 
                text from the previous revision into the current revision.</li>
            <li><img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">: Removes the highlighted 
                text from the current version so that it mirrors the previous version.</li>
            <li><img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">: Reverts the file's 
                current version to the state of the selected previous version.</li>
        </ul>
