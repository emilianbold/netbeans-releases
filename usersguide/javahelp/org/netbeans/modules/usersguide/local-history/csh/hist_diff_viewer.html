        <h2>Local History: Diff Viewer</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Diff Viewer enables you to select previously saved versions of a file 
            and compare them with the current file version. You can use the Diff Viewer to
            view two versions side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences
            between the versions being compared.</p>
            
        <p>You access the Diff Viewer by selecting a file (e.g. from the Projects or Files
            window) and choosing Show Local History.</p>
            
        <p>The upper pane of the Diff Viewer presents you with a table depicting all available 
            versions of the selected file:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version</strong>. Lists the version of the file, based on the date
                which the file was saved. Versions are listed chronologically, with the most 
                recent version at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Label</strong>. Lists any label associated with the file.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can use labels as metadata for file versions. To add a label to
                a specific file version, click on the version row beneath the Label
                column and type in a label directly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can view differences between two file versions by selecting a version from 
            the table in the upper pane of the Diff Viewer. When you select a version, the 
            table row becomes highlighted in dark gray, and the selected version displays 
            on the left side in the Diff Viewer below. The right side of the Diff Viewer 
            displays the current file version.</p>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can call commands directly on versions listed in the Diff Viewer's upper pane:
                <ul>
                    <li>To revert your current file to a selected version, right-click the version 
                        you want to revert changes to and choose Revert from History.</li>
                    <li>To delete a version from the Local History repository, right-click the 
                        version and choose Delete from History.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>The following UI components facilitate navigation among and promote visibility of 
            differences between file versions.</p>        
        
        <ul>
            <li>You can navigate among individual differences between file versions using the 
                following buttons in the toolbar:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button"> (Previous): Highlights the previous difference found between versions</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button"> (Next): Hightlights the next difference found between versions</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Differences in files are highlighted using the following colors:
        
                <ul>
                    <li><span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (Blue):
                        Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision</li>
                    <li><span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (Green):
                        Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision</li>
                    <li><span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> (Red):
                        Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>The following icons enable you to make changes directly within the Diff Viewer:
        
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="../images/insert.png" alt="replace icon"> (Replace): Inserts the
                        highlighted text from the previous revision into the current revision</li>
                    <li><img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon"> (Move All): Reverts the
                        file's current version to the state of the selected previous version.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;<img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon"> (Remove): Removes the 
                        highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the previous 
                        version.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The above color settings used to denote version differences are set by default 
                within the IDE. You can modify these settings by choosing Tools &gt; Options from 
                the main menu, then clicking Advanced Options. Expand IDE Configuration &gt; 
                Server and External Tool Settings &gt; Diff and Merge Types &gt; Diff Visualizers 
                &gt; Graphical Diff Viewer. From the right panel, you can select the colors of 
                your choice.</li>
        </ul>
