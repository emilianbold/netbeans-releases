        <h2>Importing Settings from a Previous Version of the IDE</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When you launch a new version of the IDE for the first time, you are
        prompted with the option of importing settings from a previous version of
        the IDE. This prompt occurs only if you have a user directory on your 
        system from the previous version of the IDE and the user directory is in 
        the default location.</p>
        <!--TODO Consider putting in release specific note here<ul class="note">
        <li>For NetBeans IDE 5.0, it is only possible to import settings from 
        NetBeans IDE 4.1. 
        <p>If your previous version of the IDE is NetBeans IDE 3.6 or 
        NetBeans IDE 4.0, you can install NetBeans IDE 4.1 and import the settings 
        from the previous version. Then exit the 5.0 IDE and delete its user directory. 
        When you restart 5.0, you are then given the option to import the settings 
        from the 4.1 version.</p></ul>
-->
        <p>The settings that are imported include the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
            <li>Most Source Editor font and color settings</li>
            <li>Java Platform Manager contents</li>
            <li>Library Manager contents</li>
            <li>Database drivers</li>
            <li>Servers</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Importing Settings After the First Start of the IDE</h3>
        
        <p>The opportunity to have settings imported only occurs the first time you 
        launch the new version of the IDE. If you do not import the 
        settings at the first launch but later decide that 
        you would like to import the settings, you might be able to do so by recreating the 
        conditions of the first launch. Then, 
        when you start the IDE again, the sequence of events from the first launch repeats itself, 
        including the displaying of the software license, creation of the user directory, and 
        the opportunity to import settings from the previous version of the IDE.</p>
        
        <ul class="warning">
            <li>Do not use the following technique to import settings if you have done a significant 
            amount of work in the new version of the IDE, since you could lose other important 
            settings. In addition, you might also lose any modules you have installed 
            through the Update Center in the new version.</li>
        </ul>   
        <p><b>To import settings from the previous version of the IDE if you 
did not do so the first time you launched the IDE:</b></p>
        <ol><li>Make sure that you still have the user directory from the previous version of the 
        IDE on your system in its default location.
        <p>On Microsoft Windows systems, the default location is  
        <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\.netbeans\55\</tt>.</p>
        <p>On UNIX and Linux systems, the default location is   
        <tt>/home/<i>username</i>/.netbeans/55/</tt>.</p></li>
        <li>If the new version of the IDE is running, exit the IDE.</li>
        <li>Locate the user directory of the new IDE installation.
        <p>On Microsoft Windows systems, the default location is  
        <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\.netbeans\5.0</tt>.</p>
        <p>On UNIX and Linux systems, the default location is   
        <tt>/home/<i>username</i>/.netbeans/50</tt>.</p></li>
        <li>Rename or delete the new installation's user directory.
        <li>Restart the new installation of the IDE.</li>
