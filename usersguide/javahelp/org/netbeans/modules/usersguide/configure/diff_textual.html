	<h2>Configuring the Diff Viewer</h2>
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
	<p>You can change the default Diff settings in the Options window.
	You can modify how the Textual Diff Viewer and the Graphical Diff Viewer display results when comparing file revisions using the diff command.
	You can also modify the display properties of the Graphical Merge Conflicts Resolver. </p>
	<p>To configure the diff viewer, choose Tools &gt; Options and then click the Advanced Options button in the Options window.
	In the left pane of the Options window, expand IDE Configuration &gt; Server and External Tool Settings &gt; Diff and Merge Types.</p>
	<p>You can modify the Diff Viewer and Merge Visualizer properties using the following nodes in the left pane.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Diff Engines.</b> Enables you to specify diff command options.
	    Expand the Diff Engines node to set properties to configure the following:
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Command-line Diff.</b> Click the ellipsis button (...) to specify any diff command options (for example, <tt>diff -b</tt>) to be used when running the diff command from a command-line executable in the IDE.
		Diff options are not availabe when using the built-in diff engine.
		<ul class="note">
		    <li>Before you can use the command-line diff engine on a Microsoft Windows system, you must have a command-line diff executable (for example, from a Cygwin distribution) installed on your system. 
		    For the UNIX� environment, there is a diff executable installed and available to you by default.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Built-in Diff Engine.</b> No properties are available.</li>
	    </ul></li>
	    <li><b>Diff Visualizers.</b> Enables you to set properties for the Diff viewers, which display the results when comparing file revisions using the Diff command in the IDE.
	    Expand the Diff Visualizers node to set properties to configure the following: 
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Textual Diff Viewer.</b> You can enable or disable Context Mode and specify the number of lines of context to display. 
		If Context Mode is selected, the specified number of lines of context are displayed around differences in the textual diff.</li> 
		<li><b>Graphical Diff Viewer.</b> You can modify the default background highlight colors for changed text in the graphical diff viewer.
		Click the ellipsis button (...) to specify the color.</li>
	    </ul></li>
	    <li><b>Diff Services.</b> Enables you to enable or disable the service selector.
	    Expand the Diff Services node to set properties to configure the following:
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Built-in Diff Service.</b> You can enable or disable the diff service selector. 
		If Show Diff Service Selector is selected, the drop-down list to select a diff viewer is visible in the toolbar of the diff results window.
		The service selector enables you to switch between the diff viewers.  </li>
	    </ul></li>
	    <li><b>Merge Visualizers.</b> Enables you to set the display properties for the Graphical Merge Conflicts Resolver.
	    Expand the Merge Visualizers node to set properties to configure the following:
