<p>
You use this panel in the Options window to set the keyboard shortcuts for the IDE.
You can change between pre-configured shortcut sets, create a new shortcut set, or
change the keyboard shortcut for an individual command.</p>

<p>You use this window as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose an existing keyboard set from the drop-down list at the top of 
        the dialog box.</li>
    <li>Click Duplicate to duplicate the currently selected shortcut set, then 
        edit the shortcuts in the new copy.</li>
    <li>Select the command for which you want to change a keyboard shortcut and 
        click Add or Remove in the Shortcuts section. 
        
    <p> As you press the key sequence, the correct syntax for that sequence automatically 
      appears in the text field. If you simultaneously hold down the Alt key, 
      the Control key, and the J key, "Alt+Ctrl+J" appears. To use a Backspace 
      or Tab key in the shortcut, use the buttons at the bottom of the dialog 
      box. You can only specify a keyboard shortcut that is not being used by 
      another command.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>To set keyboard shortcuts for recorded macros, go to the bottom of the Editing 
    section and select the macro name. Then edit the keyboard shortcut.</li>
    <li>The keyboard shortcut sets for other products do not necessarily provide 
    all of the functionality that those producs provide. For example, there 
    is no Visual Block editing mode in NetBeans like there is in Emacs.</li>
</ul>
