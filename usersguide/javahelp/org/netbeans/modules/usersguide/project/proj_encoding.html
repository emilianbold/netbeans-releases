        <h2>About Project Encodings</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>By default, newly-created projects in the IDE use UTF-8 character encoding. 
            This encoding determines how the IDE interprets characters beyond the 
            ASCII character set. The IDE displays and saves any new files you create 
            using the encoding set by the project in which they reside. If you
            want to change encoding properties, the IDE provides you with the ability 
            to do so manually.</p>

        <h3>Setting Character Encoding</h3>
            
        <p><strong>To change the character encoding for a project:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties.</li>
            <li>In the left column under Categories, select Sources.</li>  <!-- this needs to be verified for all project types (i.e. C++, Ruby) -->
            <li>In the Encoding drop-down list, select the character encoding that you want 
                to be applied to the project. Click OK. The new encoding is applied to the 
                project you are working in.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When you change the encoding for a project, all new files are created using 
                the new project encoding.</li>            
            <li>The new value that you set for project encoding is retained as the global 
                project encoding value for new projects. Therefore, when you create a new 
                project, the IDE uses the encoding value of the previously created project 
                for the new project.</li>
        </ul>        
            
        <h3>Encoding Detection in the IDE</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE implements the FileEncodingQuery (FEQ) layer model. FEQ is an 
            interface for obtaining information about which encoding can be used 
            for reading from/writing to a particular file. The layer model prioritizes
            encoding based on the following hierarchy:</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li><strong>File FEQ</strong>. The encoding value declared within a file.</li>
            <li><strong>Project FEQ</strong>. The value of the current global project 
                encoding in a session.</li>
            <li><strong>Fallback FEQ</strong>. The encoding of the locale in which the 
                IDE is running.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Opening Older Projects</h3>
        
        <p>Previous versions of the IDE (including 5.x) did not implement the FEQ. 
            Consequently, any project created from older versions will be opened
            using the fallback FEQ, i.e. the default locale set by your system's environment.</p>

        <br>
        <ul class="warning">    
            <li>If you change the project encoding property on a project that already 
                contains files that were created using a specific character encoding, 
                there is a risk that compiling and running the project may not succeed. 
                This is due to the fact that the programming compiler needs to be 
                passed an encoding value, and there can only be one such value.  
                Neither the IDE nor the programming language performs automatic encoding 
                detection of files.</li>
