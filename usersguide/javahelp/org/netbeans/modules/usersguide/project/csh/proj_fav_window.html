<h2>Favorites Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>
<p>The Favorites window enables you to access any file on your computer or network 
  without having to create a project for the file. You can open the Favorites 
  window by choosing Window &gt; Favorites (Ctrl-3). 
<p>When you first open the Favorites window, it only contains your computer's 
  home directory. You can add any folder to the Favorites window by right-clicking 
  in the window and choosing Add to Favorites. If the folder is registered 
  as a VCS working directory in the Versioning Manager, VCS commands are also 
  available for the folder. 
<p>Because the Favorites window does not know anything about what projects a given 
  file belongs to, none of the regular project commands like Run File and Compile 
  File are available in the Favorites window. You can run an Ant script from the 
  Favorites window as you would anywhere else in the IDE.
