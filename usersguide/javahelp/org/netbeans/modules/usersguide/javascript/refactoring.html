        <h2>Refactoring JavaScript Files</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>You can find all usages of a variable or operation within a product. 
            After finding these usages, you can rename all occurrences of the variable or operation and refactor throughout the product. 
            Before performing the refactoring, you can preview the changes in a split screen UI.</p>
        <p><strong>To find and rename all usages of a variable or operation:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select an occurrence of the variable or operation in the editor.</li>
            <li>Select Edit &gt; Find Usages (Alt-F7). You have the option of searching the comments as well as the active code.
            The Usages view opens, showing a tree view of all usages of the variable or operation.
            <li>Select the variable in the editor again and select Refactor &gt; Rename (Ctrl-R/Command-R).
            A dialog box opens in which you type the new name.</li>
            <li>Click Preview. The Refactoring view opens with a tree view of replacements on the left and a split screen of the original and refactored file on the right.</li>
            <li>You can choose not to rename the variable or operation in indiviual places. Deselect the individual renaming in the tree view on the left.
            <li>After review, click Do Refactoring and the IDE refactors all files.
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Instant Rename</h3> 
        <p>Press Ctrl-R/Command-R on a local variable and you can  rename the symbol synchronously throughout the file. </p>
