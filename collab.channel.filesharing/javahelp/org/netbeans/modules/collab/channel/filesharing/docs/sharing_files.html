<h2>Sharing Files</h2> 
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the Developer Collaboration feature to share files with other developers within a conversation. Files are shared using the Shared Files collaboration channel visible within each conversation window.</p> 
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="images/tip.gif" alt="note">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Files shared within a conversation are separate from the files you keep and edit locally. If existing local files are shared, copies of these files are made and these copies are shared instead of the originals. This ensures that no matter what happens during a conversation (accidental editing, network failure, and so on), the original files are always safe.</td>

<p><b>To share files:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>To share an existing file, drag or copy the file into the File Sharing channel of a conversation.</li> 
<li>To share a new file, select a folder node in the File Sharing channel of a conversation and use the contextual menu or File &gt; New to create the desired file.</li> 
</ul>
<p>The files are sent to the other conversation participants automatically.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="images/tip.gif" alt="note">&nbsp;</td>
<td>When other participants share files, their files appear in your File Sharing channel after a short delay. Each file shows the owner, or person who originally shared the file, after the file name.<br>
Most files shared within a conversation can be collaboratively edited in real time. In general, if the IDE can edit the content of the file locally, it will be editable once shared. See <a href="editing_files.html">Editing Shared Files</a> for more information.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>To delete a shared file or folder:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Select the file or folder node and use the Delete key or the contextual menu to remove the file or folder.<br>
You can only delete a shared file or folder if you are the owner of the file or folder.</li> 
</ul>
<p><b>To save changes made to a shared file:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Drag or copy the shared file from the File Sharing channel back to a local filesystem.</li> 
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="images/tip.gif" alt="note">&nbsp;</td>
<td>When a conversation is ended (all participants leave), all shared files are discarded and are no longer accessible. However, backups of shared files are kept for a time in your IDE user directory under the <tt>collab/shared_files</tt> folder. The number of conversation backups to keep is configurable in the File Sharing channel options under Tools &gt; Options, in the Collaboration &gt; Channels category.
