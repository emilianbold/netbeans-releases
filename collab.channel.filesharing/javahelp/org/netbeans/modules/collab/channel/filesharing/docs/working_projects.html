<h2>Working with Shared Projects and Project Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can perform actions on projects and project files that share. Which actions you can perform depend on whether you are a local or remote user -- that is, whether you are the original owner of the shared files, and whether the actions you want to perform are on projects or on project files. </p>
<p>Projects and files that are shared are subject to the following rules::</p>
<ul>
<li>File owners can run <a href="#compile">compilation</a> and debugging actions on original files in their local file systems.</li>
<li>Remote users who are sharing Projects or Project Files can see the output of a local compilation in the output window. Remote users can perform remote compilation, and run actions on Shared projects.To do so, they must invoke the actions on the shared Project node</li>
<li>When the original owner shares a Project, <tt>src</tt> files are shared. If you want to share <tt>nbproject</tt> and <tt>build.xml</tt> files you must drag and drop or copy these files individually from the IDE's Files Tab into the File Sharing Channel. </li>
<li>You can share all files in a Project. Files that are not part of a Project will reside in the Shared Non Project Files folder in the File Sharing Channel. </li>
<li>You can right-click on the New operation from the root node in the File Sharing Channel to create new shared files that are not affiliated with existing Projects in the IDE. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To build projects that are shared (local user):</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click a project node in either the original file system or in the File Sharing Channel.</li>
<li>Select the action you want to perform.<br>
You can run any project-related action, either locally or on your file system or from the File Sharing Channel. </li>
</ol>
<p><b><a name="compile">To compile files that are shared (local user):</a></b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click a source file in the original file system to perform any action related to compiling a file. </li>
<li>Select the action you want to perform. <br>
Local and remote users will see the output of this project. <br>
Local users cannot compile source files in the File Sharing Channel. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>To build projects that are shared (remote user):</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on a project node in the File Sharing Channel. </li>
<li>Select an action you want to perform. (Local and remote users will see the output of this project.) </li>
</ol>
<p><b>To work with shared files if you are the remote user: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click a shared file in your File Sharing Channel to open or edit the file.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To rename shared files if you are a local user:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Select a project node or a source node on a project.</li>
<li>Drag the project node to the File Sharing Channel.</li>
<li>On the Project Tab, select the file you want to rename.</li>
<li>Right-click that file and select Refactor.</li>
<li>Select Rename and rename the file to a name of your choosing.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To delete a shared project file if you are a local user:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, select the file you want to delete.</li>
<li>Right-click and select Delete.<br>
The file is deleted from the Projects window, from the File Sharing Channel, and from the remote user's File Sharing Channel. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>To unshare a file if you are a local user:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Select a project node or source node in the Projects window.</li>
<li>Drag the project node to the File Sharing Channel.</li>
<li>In the File Sharing Channel, select the file you want to unshare.</li>
<li>Right-click and select Stop Sharing.</li>
