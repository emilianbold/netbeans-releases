<p class="p">The Dependencies panel displays the libraires, their paths, and deployment strategies in the
project as well as enables you to add, remove, edit, and change the
order of libraries and the deployment strategies used in the project.</p><p class="p"><b>Libraries</b> - If you want to use the same set of sources in
multiple projects, you can set it in the project as a library and
share it among different users and projects as a separate project. There are
two types of libraries that can be added to a project:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing library projects. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing JAR files. </p><p class="p">Use a library that depends on a JAR file when the JAR file satisfies one of the following conditions: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file represents an API that resides on the target platform but is not deployed.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file contains classes that must be included in the JAR file generated for the project.</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>
