<li class="li"><b>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N).</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select Java Card &gt; Classic Library Project template in the New Project wizard<a name="indexterm-62"></a>
and click Next.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Set the project name and location where the IDE will create the project.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select a Java Card Platform and Card that are correctly configured for your
implementation and click Next.</b><ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><b>Unless you are creating a new library project for a custom Java Card
platform or device, the default platform and device should be used with the
standard template.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>If you are creating a new library project for a custom Java Card
platform or device, select it from the drop down list. If your custom
platform or device is not listed, use the Manage Platforms or Manage Cards
buttons to launch a manager you can use to create them. See <a href="SettingUpJavaCardPlatform.html">Setting Up a Java Card Platform</a>.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>The Base package name is set for you in the wizard by the
IDE. </b></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><b>Set the RID and PIX values for the Classic Package AID.</b><p class="p">The Classic package AID<a name="indexterm-63"></a> is a unique ID applied to the package of
the classic applet. It consists of two components, an RID value and a
PIX value.</p><ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><b>The RID value<a name="indexterm-64"></a> is the unique ID for your organization, assigned by a
standards body such as the International Standards Organization (ISO)<a name="indexterm-65"></a>. The RID is a 5
byte hexadecimal value. A default RID is provided by the plugin and can
be used during development. However, before deployment you must obtain a valid RID
from the ISO and add it to the project. To set the RID,
select Tools &gt; Options &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Java Card in the main window.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>The PIX (proprietary identifier) value<a name="indexterm-66"></a> uniquely identifies an individual Java Card package. It
is a 0 - 11 byte hexadecimal value generated by the IDE. A
specific value is not required for development. To generate a PIX value for
the package, click the Generate button.</b></li></ul></li>
<li class="li"><b>Click Finish.</b><p class="p">The IDE creates the project folder containing the source packages and libraries. You
can view, create and edit this project source code in the IDE Source
Editor to finish creating your library project.</p></li></ol>
