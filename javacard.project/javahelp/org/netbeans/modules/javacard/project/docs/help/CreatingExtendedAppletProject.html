<p class="p">The IDE enables you to create new extended applet projects from templates or
extended applet projects from existing sources. </p><p class="p">You can add more than one collection of exisiting sources (source roots) to
a project, however, after you add them to the project they cannot be
used in any other project. In addition, if the sources are already associated
with another project, you cannot add them as a source root to the
new project. To use existing sources in more than one project you must
create them as libraires and include them in project properties as a dependency.
