  <title>Getting the Transit Reference Application Sample - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="GetRefAppSample"></a><h2>Getting the Transit Reference Application Sample</h2>
   <p class="p">You can use the IDE to get a working Transit reference application sample from
the Kenai Java Card 3 repository. The Transit reference application sample demonstrates the features
of the Java Card <a name="indexterm-77"></a>API, Connected Edition and includes simple applets, libraries, and
web applications running together as a complex reference application that demonstrates the interactions between
various applications on the card using advanced features such as SIO and events.
The Transit reference application illustrates scenarios of package masking and post-manufacture installation. Documentation for configuring
and running the sample is also located in the Kenai repository. </p><ol class="ol">
