<p class="p">Unless the SSL certificate is issued by a known Certificate Authority, when you
run your custom client-server implementation, the client browser displays an error message that
the certificate provided by the server is untrusted. To continue running the application, you
must accept or configure the client browser to accept the untrusted certificate. See
your browser&#39;s documentation for the procedures required to accept untrusted certificates.</p>
