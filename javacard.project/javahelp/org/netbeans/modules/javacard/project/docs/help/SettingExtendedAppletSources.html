  <title>Setting Extended Applet Sources - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="SettingExtendedAppletSources"></a><h2>Setting Extended Applet Sources</h2>
<p class="p">The Sources panel displays the location of the project folder, enables you to
<a href="AddExistingExtendedAppletSources.html">Add Existing Extended Applet Sources</a>, <a href="RemoveExtendedAppletSourcePackages.html">Remove Extended Applet Source Packages</a>, change the order of the source roots in the project, set
the minimum source level for the JDK, and specify the file encoding used.</p><p class="p"><b>Multiple Source Root Folders</b> - You can use multiple source root folders in a project provided
that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The source roots are not used in other IDE projects</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The source roots cannot already be add to another compilation unit of the same project </p></li></ul>
<p class="p">When you add the source root to the project, you cannot use it
again in another project. If you want to use the source root in
multiple projects, set it up as a separate project and add it to
other projects as a compilation dependency between projects. See <a href="SettingExtendedAppletDependencies.html">Setting Extended Applet Dependencies</a>.</p><p class="p"><b>Source Level field</b> - The Source Level field sets the lowest Java platform version with
which the generated Java code is compatible. This setting corresponds to the <tt>javac</tt> <tt>-source</tt>
option. Setting the source level prevents using Java language constructs that are not available
in the target platform. </p><p class="p"><b>Related Information</b></p>
