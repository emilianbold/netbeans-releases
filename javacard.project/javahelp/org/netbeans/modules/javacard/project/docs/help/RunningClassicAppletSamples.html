  <title>Run HelloWorld Classic Applet Sample - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="RunningClassicAppletSamples"></a>
   <h2>Run <tt>HelloWorld</tt> Classic Applet Sample</h2>
   <p>This <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample demonstrates the basic structure of a Java Card 3 platform
classic applet that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload
classic applets. It is a minimal classic applet utilizing the simplest source code
and meta-files. This sample contains one project that demonstrates the function of a
classic applet.</p><p>Running the sample consists of using the IDE to start the <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
applet. When running, the project installs the applet, processes an incoming APDU, and responds
with a text greeting.</p>
<h2>Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Before performing the following procedure, either download and install the Java Card 3
Development Kit, Connected Edition on your development system or download the sample from
the Kenai Java Card 3 repository. See <a href="GetAdditionalClassicAppletSamples.html">Getting Additional Classic Applet Samples</a> for instructions required to download samples
from the Kenai Java Card 3 repository.</p>
<hr><p class="p"><b>Note - </b>Refer to the Development Kit documentation for additional details about working with the
Development Kit.</p>

<li><b>Click File &#62; Open Project in the main window.</b></li>
<li><b>Go to the <b></b><tt>\samples\classic_applets </tt>folder and open the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> project.</b></li>
<li><b>Click the run button in the main window. </b><p>The IDE compiles, builds, and runs the sample. When the sample runs, it
creates an output file.</p></li>
<li><b>Verify that the contents of the output file are the same as the
contents of the <tt>HelloWorld.expected.out</tt> file.</b></li></ol>
