<li class="li"><b>Select the new project in the Projects window.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select File &gt; Project Properties in the main window.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select Sources in the Project Properties window and click Add Source Root.</b></li>
<li class="li"><b>Use the Add Source Folder window to navigate to and choose the folder
containing your existing source code.</b><p class="p">When you add the source root to the project, you cannot use it
again in another project. If the source root is already used in another
project, the IDE will not permit you add it to the new project.
If you want to use the source root in multiple projects, set it
up as a separate project and add it to other projects as a
compilation dependency between projects. See <a href="SettingClassicLibraryDependencies.html">Setting Classic Library Dependencies</a>.</p></li>
<li class="li"><b>Verify the existing source code path is displayed in the Source Roots list
and click OK to add it to the project.</b><p class="p">The IDE creates the project folder containing existing code, source packages, APDU scripts,
and libraries. You can view, create and edit the project source code in
the Source Editor.</p></li>
<li class="li"><b>Select any package folders under Source Roots that were added as part of the template (but are not part of the library project) and click Delete Source Root.</b></li>
