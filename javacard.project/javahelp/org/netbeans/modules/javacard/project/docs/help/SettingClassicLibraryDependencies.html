  <title>Setting Classic Library Dependencies - Java Card 3 Development
   </title></head><body class="body"><a name="SettingClassicLibraryDependencies"></a><h2>Setting Classic Library Dependencies</h2>
<p class="p">The Dependencies panel displays the classic libraries, their paths, and deployment strategies in
the project as well as enables you to <a href="AddClassicLibrary.html">Add a Classic Library</a>, <a href="RemoveClassicLibrary.html">Remove a Classic Library</a>, change the order
of libraries, and <a href="ChangeClassicLibDeployment.html">Change a Classic Library Deployment Strategy</a> used in the project.</p><p class="p"><b>Libraries</b> - If you want to use the same set of sources in
multiple projects, you can set it in the project as a classic library
and share it among different users and projects as a separate project. There
are two types of classic libraries that can be added to a project:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing classic library projects. </p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Libraries that depend on existing classic applet JAR files<a name="indexterm-67"></a>. </p><p class="p">Use a classic library that depends on a JAR file when the JAR file satisfies one of the following conditions: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file represents an API that resides on the target platform but is not deployed.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">The JAR file contains classes that must be included in the JAR file generated for the library project.</p></li></ul>
