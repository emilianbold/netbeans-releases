<body class="body">
<a name="RunningHelloWorldSampleWebApp"></a><h2>Running <tt>HelloWorld</tt> Sample Web Application</h2>
<p class="p">The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample demonstrates the basic structure of a Java Card 3 platform
application that developers can use to develop, deploy, create, execute, delete, and unload a
stand-alone module. It is a minimal application utilizing the simplest source code and
meta-files. The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample contains one web application that demonstrates using a basic
web form to collect and display information provided by the user.</p><p class="p">Running the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> sample consists of using the IDE to open the <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
project, starting the HelloWorld application, entering a name in a web page, clicking the
Say Hello button on the page, and then displaying a greeting.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p class="p">Before performing the following procedure, the Java Card 3 Development Kit, Connected Edition
must be downloaded and installed on your development system. </p><p class="p">The <tt>HelloWorld</tt> project is located in the <b>JC_CONNECTED_HOME</b><tt>\samples\web folder</tt>.</p>
