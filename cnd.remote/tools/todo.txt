TODO:

- don't ask NB site twice about the same file:
implement logic that tracks files in remote controller

- when storing file information, paths are duplicated
(absolute paths! this consumes lots of memory)

- optimize file copying (ssh + scp? own agent?)

- remote controller: make sending reqs/receiving responses concurrent

- fix: call realpath on directories, not files (fie inexistent?)

- replace realpath w/ tracking chdir

- write tests

- don't wait for file forever; make kindof "alive" confirmations

- copy files in background upon user saves them

DONE:

- optimize: if the file is open for writing, do not ask controller
