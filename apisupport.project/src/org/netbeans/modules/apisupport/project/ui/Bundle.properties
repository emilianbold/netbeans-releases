ERR_harness_too_old=\
    You are attempting to build a module or suite project which uses a new metadata format \
    with an old version of the module build harness which does not understand this format. \
    You may either choose a newer NetBeans platform, \
    or switch the harness used by the selected platform to use a newer harness \
    (try using the harness supplied with the IDE).
