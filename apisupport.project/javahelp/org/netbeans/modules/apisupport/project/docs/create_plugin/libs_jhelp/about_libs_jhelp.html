    <h2>About Bundling Supporting Items</h2>

    The IDE provides wizards for bundling various supporting items
    with your module. Using these wizards means you can
    simply point-and-click at the items you want to include, and then the IDE
    does all the work for you.
    
    <p>You can use wizards to quickly and easily bundle the following items
    with your module:
     
    <ul>    
        <li><b>Libraries.</b> To bundle a class library so that it
        appears in the user's Library Manager, you need a Java SE library descriptor.
        <p>A Java SE library descriptor is an XML file that, when registered in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file,
        adds a new class library to the IDE's
        Library Manager. Whenever the module containing the library descriptor 
        is enabled, the library is present in the Library Manager. For example,
        Struts support provides the Struts libraries in the Library Manager.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_j2se_library_descriptor.html">Bundling a Library</a>.
        
    
        <li><b>Project Templates.</b> Project templates are used when users begin to create
        their own project. For example,
        in the IDE a user chooses the 'Web Application' project template in the New Project wizard, then the IDE
        creates a project consisting of a JSP file, a <tt>web.xml</tt> file, a server-specific deployment file,
        and project metadata within a specific structure that is useful for web application projects.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_project_template.html">Bundling a Project Template or Sample</a>.
        
        
        <li><b>Project Samples.</b> Project samples that illustrate 
        some aspect of project functionality are often provided by modules
        that inject a new technology into the IDE. For example,
        in the Samples directory within the New Project wizard, an Anagram Game is included
        to demonstrate Java SE functionality. A sample is a kind of project template; it
        has the same behavior as a project template, but it is used for a different purpose.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_project_template.html">Bundling a Project Template or Sample</a>.
        
        <li><b>Update Center URLs.</b> When you bundle the URL to
        a <a href="../filelevel_create/about_update_centers.html">update center</a>,
        you help your users, because they will not need to register your update center
        manually. Instead, when they install your module, your update center
        will automatically be accessible via the Plugin Manager. As a result, when
        your users go to Tools &gt; Plugin Manager, they will immediately see your
        update center in the 'Select Update Center(s) to connect' list. An update
        center declaration consists of the URL to the autoupdate descriptor and
        a display name.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_update_centers.html">Bundling an Update Center's URL</a>.
        
        
        <li><b>JavaHelp Help Sets.</b> The IDE provides a number of JavaHelp help sets. You can
        add your own, or, if you are creating an application on top of the NetBeans Platform,
        you can provide a help set specifically for your application. (You can also hide help
        sets provided by other modules.) The files required
        for a JavaHelp help set can be generated for you by the IDE. Registration of the
        help set in the IDE can also be automated. As a result, you do not need to think
        about these infrastuctural matters, so that you can focus your time and
        energy on the <i>content</i> of your help set.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_javahelp.html">Bundling a JavaHelp Help Set</a>.

        <li><b>License.</b> With the creation of any software, there
        is often a need for that software to have a software license.
        The IDE's support for creating modules allows
        you to add a license to the module that is under
        creation.
        <p>For details, see <a href="../filelevel_create/create_license.html">Bundling a License</a>.
