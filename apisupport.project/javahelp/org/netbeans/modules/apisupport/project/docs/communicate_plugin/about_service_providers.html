    <h2>About Service Providers</h2>

     <p>
        In version 1.3, the JDK started to use a concept called <i>service providers</i>.
        This concept introduces a completely declarative style of registration, which
        is based just on the current classpath of a Java virtual machine
        and nothing else. This has an important advantage greatly 
        contributing to the ease of use of this registration style: in order
        to change the set of registered providers, just pick up a JAR file
        that offers such a provider and include it in application classpath. 
        Immediately its provider will be accessible to all code that searches
        for it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The basic idea is that each JAR file (in NetBeans terminology, each module)
        that wishes to provide an implementation of some interface, for 
        example <tt>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</tt>,
        can create its own implementation of the interface, say 
        <tt>org.sakson.MyFactory</tt>, and expose it to the system as 
        a <i>service</i> by creating a 
        <tt>META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</tt>
        file inside of its own JAR file. The file then contains a name
        of the implementation class per line. In this example it would contain
        one line registering the sakson factory: <tt>org.sakson.MyFactory</tt>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The <tt>DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance</tt> method then searches
        for all <tt>META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</tt>
        files by using 
        <tt>ClassLoader.getResources("META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory")</tt>,
        reads their content, and instantiates the class(es) found there by
        calling their default constructors. The first implementation of the 
        <tt>DocumentBuilderFactory</tt> is then returned from the <tt>newInstance</tt>
        method.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As already mentioned, this style has been in place since JDK 1.3 and is a 
        standard way to deal with service providers. Not only has NetBeans adapted this style, 
        it is also gaining in popularity among other Java developers. As a result, 
        JDK 1.6 has introduced the new utility class 
    <classname>java.util.ServiceLoader</classname>.</p>
