        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
        
        <p>A NetBeans Platform Application
        project provides the skeleton framework on top of which you can build your own application.
        
        <p>The NetBeans Platform Application Project wizard creates a new empty 
        application. You open the New NetBeans Platform Application Project 
        wizard by opening the New Project wizard and selecting 
        the NetBeans Platform Application Project template from the NetBeans Modules category. 
        <p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following properties:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project Name. </b>Specifies the folder in which the project will
                be housed, prepended by the project location, which is specified in
            the next field.</li>
            <li><b>Project Location. </b>Specifies the location where you want to store the 
            project metadata and source code.</li>
            <li><b>Project Folder. </b>Specifies the folder where you want 
                to store the project metadata and source code. The folder is a concatenation
            of the project location and the project name.</li>
            <li><b>NetBeans Platform.</b> Specifies the platform against which the module will be compiled and deployed. To add additional
            platforms to the list, click Manage and use the <a href="NbPlatformCustomizer.html">NetBeans Platform Manager</a>.
            <li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the main
            project.</li>
        </ul>
