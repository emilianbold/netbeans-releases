	<h2>About the System Filesystem</h2>

	<p>The system filesystem is the general registry for publicly accessible data and objects.
	It is a virtual filesystem that contains NetBeans configuration information.
	NetBeans stores a wide variety of configuration information in the system filesystem. For example, the system filesystem 
	contains a folder called <tt>/Menu</tt>, which contains subfolders with names such as "File" and "Edit". 
	These subfolders contain files that represent Java classes which implement the actions that appear in 
	the "File" and "Edit" menus.
	
	<p>When you create a plug-in, you are free to create your own folders in the system filesystem to 
	store data that relate to your plug-in. You can also add objects to existing folders that have defined 
	meanings within NetBeans. One of the reasons to use the system filesystem is that it allows objects to 
	be declared, but their classes not actually loaded by the JVM until something needs to use them, thus saving
       	memory.

	<p>One important aspect of a NetBeans virtual filesystem is that it can fire events to notify the rest of 
	the system when something in it changes. NetBeans listens for changes in the system filesystem, and if, 
	for example, something creates a new object in one of the menu folders, that new item will appear in the menu.
