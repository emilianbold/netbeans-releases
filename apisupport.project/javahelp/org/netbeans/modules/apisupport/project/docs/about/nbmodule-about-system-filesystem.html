    <h2>About the System Filesystem</h2>

    The system filesystem is the central repository for configuration data in NetBeans.
    It is composed at runtime of a stack of <a href="about-xml-layers.html">XML layer files</a>
    supplied by modules in
    the system.
    It is a <i>virtual</i> filesystem that contains configuration information.
    NetBeans stores a wide variety of configuration information in the system filesystem. For example, the system filesystem 
    contains a folder called <tt>Menu</tt>, which contains subfolders with names such as <tt>File</tt> and <tt>Edit</tt>. 
    These subfolders contain files that represent Java classes which implement the actions that appear in 
    the File and Edit menus.
	
	
    <p>When you create a module, you are free to create your own folders in the system 
    filesystem to store data that relate to your module. You can also add objects 
    to existing folders. One of the reasons 
    to use the system filesystem is that it enables an application to be constructed piecemeal
    from pluggable components (modules) without requiring the use of a monolithic "master controller" that knows about everything. 
    <p>One important aspect of a NetBeans virtual filesystem is that it can fire events to notify the rest of 
    the system when something in it changes. NetBeans listens for changes in the system filesystem, and if, 
    for example, something creates a new object in one of the menu folders, that new item will appear in the menu.
