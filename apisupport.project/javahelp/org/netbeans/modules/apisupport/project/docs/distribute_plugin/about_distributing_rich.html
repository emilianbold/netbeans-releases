            Rich-client applications are complete,
            functioning, standalone Swing applications. The Swing libraries
            provide a rich collection of user interface elements. However, the Swing libraries
            do not provide a mechanism for joining the user interface elements together
            into an application. 
            For this purpose,
            NetBeans provides the <a href="../about/about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a>,
            which is the application framework on top 
            of which you build your application. Each distinct
            part of a rich-client application is provided by a separate 
            module, several of which serve to provide the user interface elements
            from the Swing libraries. For example, if your rich-client application
            is an editor, you might have one module that provides
            syntax highlighting, while another provides file templates. 
           
            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>Before you distribute a rich-client application, 
            you need to consider whether you want to leave it resembling NetBeans. 
            For example, your rich-client application uses the NetBeans splash 
            screen by default. Branding, the final stage before creating distribution packages, 
            involves making decisions such as what the splash screen should 
            look like and whether the application will include a progress bar 
            during startup. In the module suite project's Project Properties 
            dialog box, you define such settings, as described in <a href="branding_plugins.html">Branding a Rich-Client Application</a>.

            <p>While branding, also consider whether your rich-client application
            needs all the modules that the IDE uses. For example, if your rich-client
            application is not an editor, you will not need the modules that relate to
            editor functionality. Similarly, it is unlikely that all of the IDE's menu items 
            and toolbar buttons are needed by your application. 
         
            <h3>Releasing</h3>
            <p>Once a rich-client application is branded, you can distribute it over the 
            web as a web-startable JNLP application. Alternatively, you can distribute the ZIP file.
            See <a href="../build_plugin/building_jnlp.html">Building a JNLP Application</a>
            and <a href="../build_plugin/building_zip.html">Building a ZIP Distribution</a> for details.
            Updates to the modules that make up a rich-client application can be distributed 
            via the Update Center.
