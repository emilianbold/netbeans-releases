	<h2>About Project Templates</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p>
<p>Project templates come in two types:
 <ul>
	 <li>Templates that users build on when creating their own project. For example,
	 in the IDE a user chooses the 'Web Application' project template in the New Project wizard, then the IDE
	 creates a project consisting of a JSP file, a <tt>web.xml</tt> file, a server-specific deployment file,
	 and project metadata within a specific structure that is useful for web application projects.
	 <li>Samples that illustrate some aspect of project functionality. For example,
	 in the Samples directory within the New Project wizard, an Anagram Game is included
	 to demonstrate Java SE functionality. Samples are a kind of project template; they
	 have the same behavior as project templates, but they are used for a different purpose.

 </ul>
 <p>A project template is made available to the IDE's New Project wizard once it has been registered in
 the <a href="../../about/about-xml-layers.html"><tt>layer.xml</tt> file</a>. You use the 
 <a href="../../csh/SelectProjectPanel.html">New Project Template wizard</a> to create the basic files
 and to register the template in the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file.
 
 <p>Before you can use the New Project Template wizard,
 you must have project in the IDE that is structured in exactly the way that you would like it
 to be available in the New Project wizard. For example, if you are going to create a new
  project sample, you must first lay it out in the IDE. Then use the New Project Template wizard
  to add the template to the New Project wizard. 
  <p>When you make the module that contains
   the new project template available as an <a href="../../build_plugin/building_nbm.html">NBM file</a>,
   the user can install it via the Plugin Manager and then, once it has been successfully installed,
    select it from the New Project wizard.
