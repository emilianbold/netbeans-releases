Sun Studio compilers provide great capabilities for parallel programming.<br>\
There is full support of the OpenMP 3.0 specification, which contains new features to ease multicore development.<br>\
Sun Studio compilers also provide an automatic loop parallelization feature. \
The compilers can find and parallelize appropriate loops for running in parallel.<br>\
See <a href="http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/index.jsp">Sun Studio C, C++ & Fortran Compilers and Tools</a> on sun.com.

PAT_OpenMP_Title=OpenMP
PAT_OpenMP_Body=\
OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that supports \
multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++ and Fortran on many architectures, \
including Unix and Microsoft Windows platforms.<br>\
It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior.<br>\
To enable OpenMP in your project, set "Multithreading level" to "OpenMP" in compiler settings.

PAT_Parallel_Programming_Title=Parallel Computing
PAT_Parallel_Programming_Body=\
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">Parallel computing</a> is a form of computation \
in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, \
operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, \
which are then solved concurrently ("in parallel").<br>\
There are several ways to make your program parallel. The easiest one is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP">OpenMP</a>.

PAT_Feature_Title=Parallel Adviser
PAT_Feature_Body=\
Parallel Adviser feature adds support for shared-memory parallel programming in NetBeans \
to aid in development of multi-threaded applications and the transformation of single-threaded applications to multi-threaded.
