PAT_LoopParallelization_Title=Loop for parallelization has been found
PAT_LoopParallelization_Body=\
There is a <b><a href="loop">loop</a></b> in function <b><a href="function">{0}</a></b> that can benefit from parallelization.<br>\
Processor utilization is only <b>{1}%</b> now.
PAT_LoopParallelization_Notification="{0}", line {1}: There is a loop in function {2} that can benefit from parallelization.

PAT_LoopParallelizationCommon_Title=Loop parallelization
PAT_LoopParallelizationCommon_Body=\
There are many loops that could be processed in parallel.<br>\
Usually parallelization of loops leads to similar operations on elements of a big data structure.<br>\
This is called data parallelism.<br>\
You can try automatic parallelization for simple loops when you use Sun Studio compilers.<br>\
To enable automatic parallelization in your project, set "Multithreading level" to "Automatic" in compiler settings.<br>\
OpenMP directives can be used for more complex loops.<br>\
To enable OpenMP, set "Multithreading level" to "OpenMP".<br>\
Note that not all loops can be parallelized.  For example, loop-carried dependencies can prevent the use of loop parallelization. <br>\
A loop-carried dependency occurs when data dependencies exist across iterations of a loop.

PAT_UnnecessaryThreads_Title=Too many threads
PAT_UnnecessaryThreads_Body=\
The program might be using too many threads.<br>\
You can try DTrace profiler configuration to get more detailed results.

PAT_SunStudioCompilersAutomatic_Title=Automatic parallelization with Sun Studio compilers
PAT_SunStudioCompilersAutomatic_Body=\
Sun Studio compilers provide an automatic loop parallelization feature. \
When automatic parallelization is on, a compiler can find and parallelize appropriate loops to run in parallel.<br>\
Automatic parallelization with Sun Studio compilers works best for simple loops.<br>\
To enable automatic parallelization in your project, set "Multithreading level" to "Automatic" in compiler settings.<br>\
Note that not all loops can be parallelized.  For example, loop-carried dependencies can prevent the use of loop parallelization. <br>\
A loop-carried dependency occurs when data dependencies exist across iterations of a loop.
