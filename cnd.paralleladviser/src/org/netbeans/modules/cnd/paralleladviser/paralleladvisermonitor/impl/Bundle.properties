There is <b><a href="loop">loop</a></b> in function <b><a href="function">{0}</a></b> that could be effectively parallelized.<br>\
Processor utilization is only <b>{1}%</b> now.<br>\

PAT_LoopParallelization_Notification="{0}", line {1}: There is loop in function {2} that could be effectively parallelized.

PAT_LoopParallelizationCommon_Title=Loop parallelization
PAT_LoopParallelizationCommon_Body=\
There are a lot of loops that could be processed in parallel.<br>\
Usually parallelization of loops leads to similar operations on elements of some big data structure.<br>\
It's called data parallelism.<br>\
You can try automatic parallelization for simple loops that provided by <a href="sun_studio_compilers">SunStudio compilers</a>.<br>\
Or <a href="openmp">OpenMP</a> directives for more complex ones.<br>\
Remember not all loops can be parallelizes. Loop parallelization could be prevented by loop-carried dependencies.

PAT_UnnecessaryThreads_Title=Too many threads
PAT_UnnecessaryThreads_Body=\
It seems that program uses too many threads.<br>\
You can try DTrace to get more detailed results.
