/**
 * Term is a pure Java multi-purpose terminal emulator.
 * <p>
 * It has the following generic features:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>All "dumb" operations. Basically putting characters on a screen and
 *      processing keyboard input.</li>
 *      <li>ANSI mode "smart" operations. Cursor control etc.</li>
 *      <li>Character attributes like color, reverse-video etc.</li>
 *      <li>Selection service in character, word and line modes matching xterm
 *      with configurable word boundary detection.</li>
 *      <li>History buffer.</li>
 *      <li>Facilities to iterate through logical lines, to implement search for
 *      example.</li>
 *      <li>Support for nested pickable regions in order to support hyperlinked
 *      views or more complex active text utilities.</li>
 *      <li>Support for double-width Oriental characters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Coordinate systems</h2>
 * The following coordinate systems are used with Term.
 * They are all cartesian and have their origin at the top left.
 * All but the first are 0-origin.
 * But they differ in all other respects:
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>ANSI Screen coordinates
 *      <dd>
 *      Address only the visible portion of the screen.
 *      They are 1-origin and extend thru the width and height of the visible
 *      portion of the screen per getColumns() and getRows().
 *      <p>
 *      This is how an application (like 'vi' etc) views the screen.
 *      This coordinate system primarily comes into play in the cursor addressing
 *      directive, op_cm() and otherwise is not really used in the implementation.
 * <p>
 *
 * <dt>Cell coordinates
 *      <dd>
 *      Each character usually takes one cell, and all placement on the screen
 *      is in terms of a grid of cells getColumns() wide This cellular nature
 *      is why fixed font is "required". In some locales some characters may
 *       be double-width.
 *      Japanese characters are like this, so they take up two cells.
 *      There are no double-height characters (that I know of).
 *      <p>
 *      Cursor motion is in cell coordinates, so to move past a Japanese character
 *      you need the cursor to move right twice. A cursor can also be placed on
 *      the second cell of a double-width character.
 *      <p>
 *      Note that this is strictly an internal coordinate system. For example
 *      Term.getCursorCol() and getCursorCoord() return buffer coordinates.
 *      <p>
 *      The main purpose of this coordinate system is to capture logical columns.
 *      In the vertical direction sometimes it extends only the height of the
 *      screen and sometimes the height of the buffer.
 * <p>
 *
 * <dt>Buffer coordinates ...
 *      <dd>
 *      ... address the whole history character buffer.
 *      These are 0-origin and extend thru the width
 *      of the screen per getColumns(), or more if horizontal scrolling is
 *      enabled, and the whole history, that is, getHistorySize()+getRows().
 *      <p>
 *      The BCoord class captures the value of such coordinates.
 *      It is more akin to the 'int offset' used in the Java text package
 *      as opposed to javax.swing.text.Position.
 *      <p>
 *      If there are no double-width characters the buffer coords pretty much
 *      overlap with cell coords. If double-width characters are added then
 *      the buffer column and cell column will have a larger skew the more right
 *      you go.
 * <p>
 * <dt>Absolute coordinates ...
 *      <dd>
 *      ... are like Buffer coordinates in the horizontal direction.
 *      In the vertical direction their origin is the first line that was
 *      sent to the terminal. This line might have scrolled out of history and
 *      might no longer be in the buffer. In effect each line ever printed by
 *      Term gets a unique Absolute row.
 *      <p>
 *      What good is this? The ActiveRegion mechanism maintains coordinates
 *      for its' boundaries. As text scrolls out of history buffer row coordinates
 *      have to shift and all ActiveRegions' coords need to be relocated. This
 *      can get expensive because as soon as the history buffer becomes full
 *      each newline will require a relocation. This is the approach that
 *      javax.swing.text.Position implements and it's justified there because
 *      no Swing component has a "history buffer".
 *      However, if you use absolute coordinates you'll never have to
 *      relocate anything! Simple and effective.
 *      <p>
 *      Well almost. What happens when you reach Integer.MAX_VALUE? You wrap and
 *      that can confuse everything. What are the chances of this happening?
 *      Suppose term can process 4000 lines per second. A runaway process will
 *      produce Integer.MAX_VALUE lines in about 4 days. That's too close
 *      for comfort, so Term does detect the wrap and only then goes and
 *      relocates stuff. This, however, causes a secondary problem with
 *      testability since no-one wants to wait 4 days for a single wrap.
 *      So what I've done is periodically set Term.modulo to something
 *      smaller and tested stuff.
 * <p>
 * I'm indebted to Alan Kostinsky for this bit of lateral thinking.
 * </dl>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>Modes of use</h2>
 * There are three ways Term can be used.
 * These modes aren't explicit they are just a convenient way of discussing
 * functionality.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Screen mode
 *      <dd>
 *      This represents the traditional terminal without a history buffer.
 *      Applications
 *      running under the terminal assume they are dealing with a fixed size
 *      screen and interact with it in the screen coordinate system through
 *      escape sequence (ANSI or otherwise). The most common application which
 *      uses terminals in this ways is the screen editor, like vi or emacs.
 *      <p>
 *      Term will convert keystrokes to an output stream and will process
 *      characters in an input stream and render them unto the screen.
 *      What and how these streams are connected to is up to the client of Term,
 *      since it is usually highly platform dependent. For example on unixes
 *      the streams may be connected to partially-JNI-based "pty" streams.
 *      <p>
 *      This mode works correctly even if there is history and you see a
 *      scrollbar, just as it does under XTerm and it's derivatives.
 *
 * <p>
 * <dt>Buffer/Interactive mode
 *      <dd>
 *      This is the primary facility that XTerm and other derivatives provide. The
 *      screen has a history buffer in the vertical dimension.
 *      <p>
 *      Because of limited history active regions can scroll out of history and
 *      while the coordinate invalidation problem is not addressed by absolute
 *      coordiantes sometimes we don't want stuff to wink out.
 *      <br>
 *      Which is why we have ...
 *
 * <p>
 * <dt>Page mode
 *      <dd>
 *      It is possible to "anchor" a location in the buffer and prevent it
 *      from going out of history. This can be helpful in having the
 *      client of Term make sure that crucial output doesn't get lost due to
 *      short-sighted history settings on the part of the user.
 *      <p>
 *      To use Term
 *      in this mode you can use setText() or appendText() instead of
 *      connecting to Terms streams.
 *      This mode is called page mode because the most common use of it
 *      would be as something akin to a hypertext browser.
 *      To that end
 *      Term supports nestable ActiveRegions and mapping of coordinates
 *      to regions. ActiveTerm puts all of this together in a comprehensive
 *      subclass.
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>
 * <h2>What Term is not</h2>
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *      While there is an internal Buffer class, and while it behaves like a
 *      document in that it can
 *      be implicitly "edited" and character attributes explicitly changed,
 *      Term is not a document editing widget.
 *      <p>
 *      <li>
 *      Term is also not a command line processor in the sense that a MS Windows
 *      console is. Its shuttling of keyboard events to an output stream and
 *      rendering of characters from the input stream unto the screen are completely
 *      independent activities.
 *      <p>
 *      This is due to Terms unix heritage where shells (ksh, bash etc) do their own
 *      cmdline and history editing, but if you're so inclined the LineDiscipline
 *      may be used for experimentation with indigenous cmdline processing.
 * </ul>

     * ScrollWrapper is a HACK that allows us to make pairs of scrollbars
     * look nice.
     * <p>
     * A JScrollPane, or more specifically ScrollPaneLayout, arranges
     * a pair of vertical and horizontal scrollbars as follows:
     *                   | |
     *                   | |
     *                   |v|
     *      -------------
     *                 >|
     *      -------------
     * ... so that here is a nice square corner.
     *
     * But ScrollPaneLayout insists that it's viewport is a JViewport and that
     * it's container is a JScrollPane. It is probably possible to make the
     * screen be a JViewPort and use a JScrollPane to contain the screen, but
     * it's very tricky. (For that matter it should be possible to avoid doing
     * our own scrolling altogether and use JScrollPane functionality, but
     * it's also tricky).
     *
     * Since we're using a BorderLayout putting the horizontal SB in the SOUTH
     * portion yields something like this:
     *                   | |
     *                   | |
     *                   |v|
     *      ----------------
     *                    >|
     *      ----------------
     * Soooo, to make things look right, we use ScrollWrapper to control the
     * sizing of the horizontal scrollbar. It basically uses a GridBagLayout
     * and GridBagConstraints.insets to create the square corner.

     * get some slowdown, but worse if say a large file with long lines is
     * being 'cat'ed Term will end up scrolling left and right. It would be

     * because (because of non-local echoing) the cursor isn't yet updated when
     * a key has been pressed.
     * Additionally, a key may result in more than character being echoed.
     * for example, an ENTER might result in a "\n\r", a TAB in 8 ' 's,
     * and a '\b' in a "\b \b" sequence so a single flag won't do.
     * Instead we use a count, 'hscroll_count' which says: attempt
     * possiblyHScroll() on the next <n> received characters. It may happen
     * there there is a lot of keyboard input and very little output. In
     * such cases 'hscroll_count' will start accumulating a defecit. To

    /**
     * Draw characters in cells.
     *
     * Fixed width or monospaced fonts implies that the glyphs of all characters
     * have the same width. Some non-latin characters (japanese) might have
     * glyph widths that are an _integer multiple_ of the latin glyphs. Thus
     * cellular (grid based) text widget like this termulator can still place
     * all characters nicely. There is a 'C' function wcwidth() which
     * ... determines the number of _column_ positions ... and CDE's DtTrem
     * ultimately depends on it to place things. (See also Tuthill & Smallberg,
     * "Creating worldwide software" PrenticeHall 2nd ed. p98)
     *
     * Unfortunately the fonts used by Java, even the "monospaced" fonts, do
     * not abide by the above convention. I measured a 10pt ja locale latin
     * character at 7 pixels wide and a japanese character at 12 pixels wide,
     * instead of 14. A similar problem existed with respect to the "unprintbale"
     * placeholder square. Until Java 1.4 it used to be 9 or 10 pixels wide!
     * The square is fixed, but I"m not sure the above will be anytime soon.
     *
     * What this means is that Graphics.drawString() when given a mix and match
     * of latin and japanese characters will not place them right. Selection
     * doesn't work etc.
     *
     * Nor does Java provide anything resembling wcwidth() so we're rolling
     * our own here. That's done in Line.width().
     *
     * So one approach would be to place each character individually, but it's
     * rather slow. Fortunately Java provides a GlyphVector class that allows
     * us to tweak the positions of the glyphs. The timing I"ve gotten are
     *		50	for one drawChars() per charactr. (SLOWER below)
     *		15	using the GlyphVector technique
     *		8	using plain drawChars
     * Unfortunately GlyphVector's interface leaves a bit to be desired.
     * - It does not take a (char [], offset, length) triple and depends
     *   on the length of the char array passed in. Since our Line char arrays
     *   have some slop in them we can't pass them directly. Hence the
     *	 "new char[]" and the "System.arraycopy".
     * - The interface for getting and setting positions is also a bit
     *	 awkward as you may notice from massage_glyphs().
     *
     * We SHOULD fall back on plain drawChars() if the host charset is an
     * 8 bit encoding like ASCII or ISO 8859. This encoding is available
     * via System.getProperty("file.encoding") but there are so many aliases
     * for each that I"m wary of hardcoding tests. See
     * http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets
     * Java 1.4 has class Charset that helps with the aliases but we can't
     * yet lock into 1.4.

         * scrolling ... (note: a lot of this is based on experiments with
         * Term as a unix terminal emulator application as opposed to
         * within the context of NetBeans).
         *
         * Term spends it's time between collecting and deciphering input
         * and repainting the screen. Input processing always goes on, but
         * screen repainitng can be done more or less often to trade off
         * smoothness of scrolling vs speed.
         *
         * At one end is so-called smooth scrolling. This is where the
         * screen is redrawn on every linefeed. That's a lot of painting.
         * To get into that mode use the paintImmediately() below and
         * uncomment the call to us in op_line_feed(). Also
         * paintImmediately() doesn't really work unless the Screen is
         * opaque. I think that is because the paint request comes
         * to us and we don't forward it to screen; but it could be a
         * Swing bug too. Term is very slow in this. For example I"ve
         * time xterm and DtTerm dealing with "cat /etc/termcap" in 2-3
         * seconds while Term takes 20-25 seconds. Part of this is
         * attributed to the fact that Term doesn't take advantage of
         * bitBlitting when it's adding one line at a time and still
         * redraws everything. However I'll make a case below that this
         * isn't that important.
         *
         * Then there is so-called jump scrolling. In this regime terminal
         * emulators redraw the screen "as time permits". This is in effect
         * what the swing repaint manager helps with. Multiple repaint()
         * requests translate to one actual paint(). With todays computers
         * it's very hard to tell visually that you're jump scrolling
         * things go by so fast (yes, even under Swing), so this is the
         * preferred setup.
         * Here term does a bit better. To deal with a cat'ed 100,000
         * line file DtTerm takes 8 seconds, while Term takes 22 seconds.
         * (That's 3 times slower vs 8 times). From some measurements
         * I've made the number of linefeeds per actual paints has
         * ranged from > 100 to upper 30's. These numbers are sufficiently
         * high that the whole screen has to be repained everytime.
         * I.e. blitting to scroll and drawing only what's new isn't
         * going to help here. To get reasonable jump-scrolling, you need
         * to make sure that the Screen is opaque because if you don't
         * you will get ...
         *
         * Jerky scrolling. If Term is not opaque, the number of actual
         * paints per repaint() requests diminishes drastically. 'cat' of
         * etc/termcap (once the code has been warmed up) sometimes causes
         * a single refresh at the end in contrast to ~100 when Screen
         * is opaque. Naturally Term in this mode can eat up input at
         * a rate comparable to dtterm etc, but the jerkiness is very
         * ugly.
         * Opacity isn't the only criterion. Term, when embeded inside a
         * tabbed pane (like it is in NetBeans) will also act as if it's
         * opaque and you get more frequent refreshes, as in the
         * jump-scrolling regime. But that was way too slow for the
         * taste of NB users which is why OutputTab window calls us on a
         * timer. That brings it's own jerkiness of a different sort.
         *
         * There is a third factor that contributes to slowness. If you
         * just 'cat' a file you get the numbers I presneted above. But
         * if you run an app that actually puts out the 100,000 lines
         * some sort of timing interaction forces Term into near smooth
         * scrolling and as a result things slow down a lot! For example,
         * 	$ generate_100K_lines > /tmp/bag	00:08 sec
         *	$ cat /tmp/bag				00:20 sec
         *	$ generate_100K_lines			03:42 sec (opaque)
         *	$ generate_100K_lines			01:58 sec (!opaque)
         * This happens even if the generating program is a lightweight
         * native application. In fact I believe it is this effect that
         * forced NB's OutputTab to adopt the timer. I believe there are two
         * factors that contrinute to this.
         * a) Running applications are line buffered so putChars(), with
         *    it's attendant repaint(), gets called once per line pushing
         *    us into the smooth scrolling regime. (But why then doesn't
         *    DtTerm suffer from this?)
         * b) timeslicing gives enough time to the repaint manager such
         *    that it converts evey repaint() to a paint.
         * I know (b) is a factor since if I "simulate" (a) by issueing
         * repaints() from op_line_feed() while keeping this function from
         * using paintImmediately() I don't get that many paints.
         * The combined case has 44 paints per repaint as does simulated (a).
         * So ain increased number of paints per repaint doesn't
         * explain this.
         *
         * In the end, currently since jump scrolling is still not very
         * fast and since NB has the timer anyway, Screen is not opaque.
         *
         * A useful quantitative measure is the number of linefeeds vs
         * the number of repaint requests vs the number of actual paints.
         * All these are collected and can be dumped via op_time() or
         * printStats().

    /**
     * Since Term is a composite widget the main accessible JComponent is
     * not Term but an internal JComponent. We'll speak of Term accessibility
     * when we in fact are referring to the that inner component.
     * <p>
     * Accessibility for Term is tricky because it doesn't fit into the
     * roles delineated by Swing. The closest role is that of TEXT and that
     * is too bound to how JTextComponent works. To wit ...
     * <p>
     * <dl>
     * <dt>2D vs 1D coordinates
     * <dd>
     *     Term has a 2D coordinate system while AccessibleText works with 1D
     *     locations. So Term actually has code which translates between the two.
     *     This code is not exactly efficient but only kicks in when assistive
     *     technology latches on.
     *     <br>
     *     Line breaks ('\n's) count as characters! However we only count
     *     logical line breaks ('\n's appearing in the input stream) as opposed to
     *     wrapped lines!
     *     <p>
     *     The current implementation doesn't cache any of the mappings because
     *     that would require a word per line extra storage for the cumulative
     *     char count. The times actually we're pretty fast with a 4000 line
     *     histroy.
     *
     * <dt>WORDs and SENTENCEs
     * <dd>
     *     For AccessibleText.get*Index() functions WORD uses the regular
     *     Term WordDelineator. SENTENCE translates to just a line.
     *
     *     <dt>Character attributes
     *     <dd>
     *     Term uses the ANSI convention of character attributes so when
     *     AccessibleText.getCharacterAttribute() is used a rough translation
     *     is made as follows:
     *     <ul>
     *     <li> ANSI underscore -> StyleConstants.Underline
     *     <li> ANSI bright/bold -> StyleConstants.Bold
     *     <li> Non-black foreground color -> StyleConstants.Foreground
     *     <li> Explicitly set background color -> StyleConstants.Background
     *     </ul>
     *     Font related information is always constant so it is not provided.
     *
     * <dt>History
     * <dd>
     *     Term has history and lines wink out. If buffer coordinates were
     *     used to interact with accessibility, caretPosition and charCount
     *     would be dancing around. Fortunately Term has absolute coordinates.
     *     So positions returned via AccessibleText might eventually refer to
     *     text that has gone by.
     *
     * <dt>Caret and Mark vs Cursor and Selection
     * <dd>
     *     While Term keeps the selection and cursor coordinates independent,
     *     JTextComponent merges them and AccessibleText inherits this view.
     *     With Term caretPosition is the position of the cursor and selection
     *     ends will not neccessarily match with the caret position.
     * </dl>
     * <p>
     * Currently only notifications of ACCESSIBLE_CARET_PROPERTY and
     * ACCESSIBLE_TEXT_PROPERTY are fired and that always in pairs.
     * They are fired on the receipt of any character to be processed.
     * <p>
     * IMPORTANT: It is assumed that under assistive technology Term will be
     * used primarily as a continuous text output device or a readonly document.
     * Therefore ANSI cursor motion and text editing commands or anything that
     * mutates the text will completely invalidate all of AccessibleTexts
     * properties. (Perhaps an exception SHOULD be made for backspace)
