<h2>Converting a BlueJ Project to a Standard IDE Project</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>If you no longer need the BlueJ visual representation of classes and need to use 
the capabilities of standard IDE projects, you can convert your BlueJ 
projects to NetBeans IDE projects.</p>

<p><b>To convert a BlueJ project into a NetBeans IDE project:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the BlueJ project in NetBeans IDE.</li>
    <li>In the Projects window, right-click the project's node and choose 
    Convert to Java SE Project.</li>
</ol>
    <p>When you convert a BlueJ project into a standard Java SE project, 
    the IDE copies the sources from your existing project and places them 
    into a new project, where sources and compiled classes are separated into 
    different folders. Your BlueJ project remains, but is separate from the 
    newly created project. The converted project is not visible in the BlueJ view 
and can not be opened in BlueJ. </p> 
<p>In the converted project, you can easily manage the classpath through 
 the Libraries node. You can manage the way the application is built and packaged 
through the Project Properties dialog box, which you can open by right-clicking the project's node and choosing 
Properties.
