<h2>Using General NetBeans IDE Help in the BlueJ Edition</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The help topics in the NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition Help section of the table of 
contents provide information specific to the BlueJ Edition of the IDE. The rest of 
the help files were written for the standard edition of NetBeans IDE. Though most of 
the topics contain valid information for the BlueJ Edition, some details may not 
apply to the BlueJ Edition.</p>
