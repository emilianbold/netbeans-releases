<h2>Ruby on Rails Project Properties: Rails Options</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> </p>


<p>Use this  dialog box to set the Rails options for  a Ruby on Rails project. You open the dialog box by right-clicking the main project node in the Projects window, choosing Properties, and then selecting the Rails node in the Project Properties dialog box.</p>
  <!--
<ul class="note">
  <li>When you click OK, an Installation dialog box opens and shows you the progress of your download. In addition, you might be prompted by the plugin's download program to specify some information for the plugin, so keep an eye on the Installation dialog while the download is happening.</li>
</ul>
-->
  <p>You can set the following options:
<ul>
  <li><b>Ruby Platform.</b> Select the platform that you will use for the project from the drop-down list. To use a platform other than what is displayed in the list, click Manage  to open the Platform Manager.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Configuration.</b> Select the configuration for
    the desired Rails project settings. To create a new configuration, 
    click New, type a Profile Name, and click OK. You can then modify
    the settings for that profile, such as specifying
    a different server or Rails environment. You can switch
    a project's current configuration using this drop-down list, or by right-clicking
    the project node and choosing Set Configuration from the pop-up menu.
  </li>
  <li><b>Server. </b>Select the server that you want to use for the application. </li>

  <li>
    <b>Server Port Number.</b> For the WEBrick and Mongrel servers,
    use this text box to specify the starting point for 
    finding a free port. When the specified
    port is available, the IDE uses that port for running the server,
    otherwise the IDE increments the port by one until it finds a free port. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Rails Environment.</b> Select which mode you want to 
    run the application in:  development, production,  test, or a custom
    environment that you have created in the
    <tt>config/environments</tt> folder. You can also type
    a value.
  </li>
  <li><b>Encoding.</b> Sets the character encoding for your application, which is used by the IDE when writing files to disk. The default encoding is UTF-8. </li>
  <li><b>Rake Arguments</b>. Passes custom flags to Rake when run from the IDE. </li>
