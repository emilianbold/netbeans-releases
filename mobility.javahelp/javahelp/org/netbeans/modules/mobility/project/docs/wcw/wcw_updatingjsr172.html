<h2>Updating  Java ME Web Services Client Files</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>


<p>You can use the <a href="wcw_updatingjsr172.html">J2ME Web Services Client 
  wizard</a> or the<a href="wcw_wsdl.html"> Mobile Client to Web Application Generator</a> 
  to create a MIDP client/server connection. </p>
<p>After you have created the client and connection files, you can not manually 
  edit them. You can, however, regenerate them with different settings using the 
  Settings file, which is displayed in the Editor after you generate the the original 
  application, or when you open the Settings file in the Editor window. </p>
<p><strong>To open the  Settings file: </strong></p>
<p>In the Files or Projects window, expand the project and double-click on the 
  appropriate node (<code>.wsclient file</code>). <br>
The Web Services Settings File opens in the Editor window. </p>
<p><strong>To make changes in the generated files:</strong></p>
<p>You can change the selection of services the application uses, and edit any
  of the following fields: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client Information.</strong> This information cannot be edited. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>Client Options: </strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generate stubs. </strong>Generates stub methods on the client for
        each exported service. Method names are incorporated in the class name. Using<tt> HelloService</tt> for
        example, the <tt>sayHello()</tt> method is exported. The generated stub method
        creates a method on the client called <tt>example_HelloService_sayHello().</tt> If
      this option is not selected, only one method is generated on the client.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate grouped calls. </strong>Generates additional code
        to support making multiple calls to server-side services in a single
        HTTP request or
        response. When turned on with the Generate Stub Methods option also turned
        on, a generated method is created on the client for each exported service
        with the stub method name ending in <tt>Grouped</tt>. Using <tt>HelloService</tt> for
        example, the <tt>sayHello()</tt> method is exported. The generated stub
        method<br>
        creates a method on the client called <tt>example_HelloService_sayHelloGrouped()</tt>.
        <p> When the option is selected, the server is called only after several
          grouped calls are made and the <tt>getGroupedResults() </tt>method on the
          client class is called. All the method calls are invoked in a single HTTP
          request and response. Methods are invoked in the order they were called.
          Results are returned in an enumeration object. </p>
        <p>If a server call causes an exception, the exception is thrown when <tt>getGroupedResults()</tt> is
          called. When an exception is thrown in a sequence of grouped calls, the calls
          following the exception are not processed. </p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Allow floating point.</strong> Activates support for float and
        double data types.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate tracing code.</strong> Generates tracing code that
        provides runtime information during the execution of remote calls. Client
        tracing
        output goes to the MIDP implementation standard output. Server tracing
        output goes to the server log file. Turn this option on to generate versions
        of
        client and server tracing code to help you if connection problems occur
        between the client and the server. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you  need to convert CLDC 1.1 types
        to CLDC 1.0 types, you will need to convert Float and Double types to
        String variables. To make the conversion, check the Convert Floating
          Point to
        String checkbox  in the settings panel. (This field might not be available
    in all instances.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To regenerate the application: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the Generate Stubs button to regenerate the stub classes.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
  <li>If you have deleted or updated the local WSDL file, you also need to refresh 
    the WSDL file. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To refresh the WSDL file:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Refresh WSDL button. <br>
  If you have changed the WSDL file, you will be asked to if you want to change
  your local WSDL file and update the stub files. </li></ul>
<ul class="note"> <li>If you are using a proxy server, you must set the proxy by choosing Tools>Options
    in the Main Menu.</li></ul>
<ul class="note">
  <li>If you are regenerating a three-tier application (an application generated 
    by the Mobile Client to Web Application Generator), you will need to build 
    and re-deploy the application. </li>
