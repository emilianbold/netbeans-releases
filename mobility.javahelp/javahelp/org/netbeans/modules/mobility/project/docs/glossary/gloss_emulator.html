<p>An emulator is a representation used by the Integrated Development Environment 
  (IDE) to simulate how your application will operate on a type of mobile device, 
  such as a cellular phone or two-way pager. Emulator platforms include specific 
  device examples, or <em>skins</em>, that simulate the operations of a specific 
  device. </p>
