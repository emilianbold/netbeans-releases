<h2>About Java ME Deployment</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>One of the most challenging aspects of developing Java ME applications is that MIDlets are created 
on one platform, such as Linux or Windows, but  are deployed to MIDP and CDC devices running on 
completely different  platforms. <em>Deployment</em>  is the process of transferring the 
application you develop in the IDE to a mobile device or to a server for further testing or 
implementation.</p>
<p>The IDE supports several methods of deployment, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="../deploy/deploy_devanywhere.html">Device Anywhere Deployment</a></strong>. 
        Website for professional mobile developers  that allows you to remotely deploy MIDlet suites to the most popular mobile devices on the market today. (Registration required).</li>
  <li><strong><a href="deploy_copy.html">File Copy</a></strong>. Moves the MIDlet 
    suite files to a specified location on a local system.</li>
  <li><a href="deploy_ftp.html"><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong></a>. 
    Uses the file transfer protocol to move the MIDlet suite files to a remote 
    server over the Internet.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="deploy_nokia.html">Nokia Mobile Devices</a></strong>. Transfers the MIDlet suite files to a Nokia Mobile device from the 
  IDE using Nokia's PC Suite.</li>
  <!--<li><strong><a href="deploy_ricoh.html">Ricoh Devices</a></strong>. Transfers the CDC application to a Ricoh device using HTTP POST or  SD card.</li>-->
  <li><strong><a href="deploy_scp.html">Secure Copy (SCP, SFTP)</a></strong>. Establishes 
    a secure connection and encrypts the data before passing the data between 
    the client and server. </li>
  <!--<li><a href="deploy_se.html"><strong>Sony Ericsson Phone (locally attached device)</strong>.</a> 
    Transfers the MIDlet suite files to a Sony Ericsson phone. This deployment 
    method also enables you to run and debug the on-device application from the 
    IDE. </li>-->
  <ul class="note">
    <li>You must have a Sony Ericsson Sony Ericsson (On-Device Debug) emulator 
        installed to use this option.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="deploy_webdav.html"><strong>Web-based Distribution WebAuthoring 
    and Versioning (WebDAV)</strong></a>. Moves MIDlet suite 
    files using the Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocols, 
    a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows you to work in collaboration 
    with others to edit and manage files on remote web servers.</li>
 <li><strong><a href="deploy_winmobile.html">Windows Mobile Devices</a></strong>. Transfers the MIDlet suite files to a 
 Windows Mobile device from the IDE using ActiveSync and Sun's CLDC/MIDP Virtual Machine.</li>
</ul>
