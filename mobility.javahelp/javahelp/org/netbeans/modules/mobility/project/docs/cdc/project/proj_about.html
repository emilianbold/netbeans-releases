<h2>About CDC Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you build, 
  run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all Java development has to take 
  place within a project. </p>
<p>The IDE builds its project infrastructure directly on top of Apache Ant, the
  leading build tool for Java applications. The IDE stores all of the information
  about your project in an Ant script, a properties file, and a few XML configuration
  files. This means that you can build and run your projects outside of the IDE
exactly the same as inside the IDE.</p>
<p>When a project is created, the IDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates a source tree you can examine in the Projects or Files views.</li>
  <li>Sets the emulator platform for the project. </li>
  <li>Sets the project run and compile-time classpaths.</li>
  <li>Creates a build script that contains actions for running, compiling, debugging, 
    and building Javadoc.
	</ul>
    <h3>Project Templates</h3>
    
<p>With project templates, the IDE controls all aspects of how your application 
  is built, run, and debugged. You set a project's source directory, classpath, 
  emulator platform, and other project settings when creating the project and 
  in the Project Properties dialog box.</p>
<p>The NetBeans Mobility Pack for CDC comes with the following Java ME templates:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CDC Application.</strong> Creates a new CDC application in a standard 
    IDE project. You can also generate a main class in the project. Standard projects 
    use an IDE-generated Ant build script to build, run, and debug your project.</li>
  <li><strong>CDC Class Library.</strong> Creates a new CDC library in a standard 
    IDE project. A CDC library does not contain a main class. </li>
  <li><strong>CDC Project with Existing Sources.</strong> Imports an existing 
    CDC application into a standard IDE project. The CDC application can have 
    multiple source folders.</li>
  <li><strong>CDC Project with existing Ant Script.</strong> Imports an existing 
    Java CDC application into a <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.java.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/java/helpset/docs/project/proj_free_about.html">free-form 
    IDE project</a>. A free-form project uses your existing Ant build script to 
    run, compile, and debug your project.</li>
</ul>
<h3>File Templates</h3>
<p>With file templates, you specify a project, file name and location. The IDE 
  creates the basic structure of the file, and adds it to the Application Descriptor 
  file. Besides standard file templates known from J2SE projects (for example, 
  Java class, Java interface, XML file, and others), the Java ME CDC project offers 
  the following templates: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AGUI Xlet Form. </strong>Creates a new Xlet for applications using 
    the AGUI profile. This template contains form code that allows you to design 
    the Xlet visually in the Form Editor.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Profile Xlet Form.</strong> Creates a new Xlet for applications 
    using the Personal Profile. This template contains form code that allows you 
    to design the Xlet visually in the Form Editor. </li>
  <li><strong>Xlet.</strong> Creates a new xlet .This template does not contain 
    form code that allows you to design the Xlet visually in the Form Editor. 
    For visual design, start with the AWT template under Java GUI Forms.</li>
</ul>
