<h2>About Preprocessor Directives</h2>
<p>Most <a href="preprocess_about.html">preprocessing </a>is controlled by preprocessor
  directives.  Directives are specified
  within the source code by creating a commented line that starts with the <code>//#</code> character
  sequence, immediately followed by the directive. For example, <code>//#ifdef</code>.  </p>
<p>Like the XML language, preprocessor directives  must be <em>well-formed</em>.
  That is, they must have a beginning directive and an ending directive. For
  example,
  when a block is started with one of
  the <code>//#if</code> directives,
  it must be closed by an <code>//#endif</code> directive. Blocks can be nested,
  which means that inside an <code>if/elif/else/endif</code> block can
be any number of additional <code>if/elif/else/endif</code> blocks. </p>
<p>Directives define actions and conditions. The preprocessor decides upon whether 
  to comment or uncomment the block of code. Symbols in directive expressions 
  can be either defined or not defined. Identifiers and variables, however, must 
  always contain a value that can be used or compared during preprocessing. The 
  preprocessor supports three types of variables: strings, integers, and booleans. 
</p>
<p>Variable names must start with characters/tokens which are same as start characters/tokens of valid Java
  identifiers but in addition, consequentive characters can also be '.' '\' and '/'. . You can compare different variable
  types using common comparison syntax (<code>&lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt; </code>and<code> ==</code>).
  You can also use boolean operations, such as <code>&amp;&amp;, ||, ! </code>and<code> ^</code>. You can also
  use &lt;variable name&gt;:defined or defined(&lt;variable name&gt;) functions to check for variable defintions.  This
  is not neccessary and should not be used when creating new code blocks but is built in for easy imports from J2ME Polish.
  For more information, see <a href="preprocess_comparison.html">Comparing Preprocessor
  Variables</a>. </p>
<p>The following example shows <code>If/Else</code> block with a nested <code>elif</code> directive.
<pre>//#if mmedia 
   //#if nokia
        //#if s60_ver==&quot;1.0&quot;
        import com.nokia.mmapi.v1
        //#elif s60_ver==&quot;2.0&quot; 
        import com.nokia.mmapi.v2
       //#else
       import com.nokia.mmapi.def
       //#endif
  //#else
      import javax.microedition.mmapi
  //#endif
//#endif </pre>
<li>
The NetBeans IDE supports all directives of the Antenna preprocessor 
  <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://antenna.sourceforge.net">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://antenna.sourceforge.net</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="small">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
  </object>
,  so you can migrate Antenna projects into the NetBeans IDE and retain your
preprocessor code.

</ul>
<h3>Directive Syntax</h3>
<p>See the following table for a description of preprocessor directives. </p>
<table width="95%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="center"><strong>Directive</strong></div></td>
    <td><div align="center"><strong>Description</strong></div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="34%"><code>#ifdef </code>[identifier]</td>
    <td width="66%">The identifier represents a variable of any type (boolean,
      string, or integer) and checks whether or not the variable is defined.
      If true (the variable is defined), the code that
      follows is processed.  Nested blocks are processed as well.
      If false (the variable is not defined),
      the
      code
      that follows
      is commented and nested blocks are not evaluated. The directive
      must be closed with <code>#endif</code>.      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#ifndef </code>[identifier]</td>
    <td>Works in the same manner as <code> ifdef, </code>but returns &quot;True&quot;
      if the variable is not defined. The directive must be closed with <code>#endif</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#elifdef </code>[identifier]</td>
    <td>Works as a standard <code>else if</code> statement, but automatically
      checks whether or not the identifier is defined. The directive can only
      complement inside blocks started
    by <code>ifdef/ifndef</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#elifndef </code>[identifier]</td>
    <td>Works as a standard <code>else if</code> statement but automatically
      checks whether the identifier is not defined. The directive can only complement
      inside blocks started
    by <code>ifdef/ifndef.</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#if </code>[expression]</td>
    <td>Evaluates an expression passed to it and fires the appropriate action.
      The directive must be closed with
    <code>endif</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#elif </code>[expression]</td>
    <td>Works as a standard <code>else if </code>statement and can complement
      only in blocks started by <code>an if</code> statement. The directive preprocesses
      the code that follows based on the result of the expression.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#else</code></td>
    <td>Works as a standard <code>else</code> statement only preprocesses
      the code that follows when none of the previous conditions in the defining
      block
      were true. Complements
    inside any block started with the <code>if/ifdef/ifndef</code> directive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#endif</code></td>
    <td>This directive must be used to close any block started with <code>if/ifdef/ifndef</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#condition </code>[expression]</td>
    <td>Must be on the first line in a file. This directive determines if the
    file should be included in the build based on the result of the expression.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#debug</code> [level]</td>
    <td>Determines if the line following the directive should be commented or
      uncommented based on the debug level set in <a href="../ui/projectprop_compiling.html">Compiling
      page</a> of the project
      properties. If the debug level is omitted and the debug level is not set
      to &quot;Off&quot; in
      the project properties, the preprocessor will automatically debug the line
      in question. Used
      for debugging
      purposes
    with expressions such as <code>System.out.println</code>,
    for example. This directive can be nested.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#mdebug</code> [level]</td>
    <td>Behaves the same as<code> #debug, </code>but instead comments or uncomments
      a whole block of lines following the line it is on until it reaches <code>#enddebug</code>.
      This directive is used for debugging purposes  with expressions
      such as <code>System.out.println</code>,
      for example. This directive can be nested.      If the <code>mdebug</code> block
      partially intersects an <code>if/ifdef/ifndef</code> block (for example,
      <code>enddebug</code> is outside a closed <code>if </code>block in which <code>mdebug</code> is
      called) the preprocessor will generate errors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#enddebug</code></td>
    <td>Must terminate <code>#mdebug</code> block.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>#define [identifier] #define [identifier=value] #define [identifier value]</code></td>
    <td>Adds temporary abilities or variables to the preprocessor memory.  Can
      not be used in nested blocks. Global variables defined in
      the project configuration properties override these temporary variables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>#undefine [identifier]</td>
    <td>Removes temporary abilities/variables from the memory. This declaration
      can also be used to remove global variables defined in the project configuration
      properties from
      the preprocessor memory, but will not remove the variables from the list
      of project or configuration variables.</td>
