<h6>Game Designer: Sprites</h6>
<p>Sprites are a layer type for creating scenes in the Game Designer and are typically 
used to create characters or other animated objects in a game. The sprite is displayed on the top layer of the game and moves according to rules that define how 
they react to a player's actions, other sprites, or other objects in the game environment. </p>
