<h6>Game Designer: Tiled Layers</h6>
<p>Tiled Layers are used to create scenes in the Game Designer. When you create a tiled layer you can specify the height and width of the square and choose the image you want to use to produce a visual background in the game scene. Tiling images produces  a full screen background using one or more small files rather than  using a large, full screen  image.</p>
