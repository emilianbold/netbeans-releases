<h2>About Visually Designing MIDP Applications</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Visual Mobile Designer (VMD) enables you to visually design your application's 
  work flow and graphical user interface (GUI). As you drag and drop objects into 
  the Flow and Designer windows, the IDE generates and updates the Java code that 
  implements your design.</p>
<p>To use the VMD, you work with files created by the VMD <a href="../projects/proj_templates.html">templates</a>, 
  available from the New File wizard. You cannot use the VMD to edit GUI forms 
  that were created outside of the IDE. Note also that if you edit the code generated 
  by the VMD in the Source Editor (code within the gray shaded areas), you can 
  no longer work in the visual mode. </p>
<p>The VMD provides the following tools to simplify the process of
  designing your MIDP applications, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="../ui/mvd_flowdesigner.html">Flow Designer</a>.</strong> 
    The primary workspace for the VMD. In this space, you map out the flow of 
    the application by adding screens and other UI components, and associating 
    commands with the components. It enables you to view forms in both Source 
    and Design views.</li>
  <li><a href="../ui/mvd_screendesigner.html"><strong>Screen Designer</strong></a><strong>.</strong> 
    Enables you to design and modify screens within your application.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="../ui/mvd_inspector.html">Inspector Window</a>.</strong> 
    Displays a tree hierarchy of all components contained in the currently active 
    application, including screens, commands, and resources.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="../ui/mvd_componentpallette.html">Component Palette.</a></strong>
    Contains the Java objects you can add to your application.</li>
  <li><a href="../ui/mvd_componentpallettemanager.html"><strong>Component Palette 
    Manager.</strong> </a>Enables you to add your own screens and objects to the 
    Component Palette.</li>
  <li><a href="../ui/mvd_properties.html"> <strong>Properties Sheet.</strong></a> 
    Displays the editable settings for the currently selected component.</li>
</ul>
