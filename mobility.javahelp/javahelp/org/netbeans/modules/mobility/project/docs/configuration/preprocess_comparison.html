<h2>Comparison Syntax in Preprocessor Directives </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>The preprocessor supports three types of variables: </p>
<ul>
  <li>strings</li>
  <li>integers</li>
  <li>boolean values</li>
</ul>
<p>Most common comparisons (<code>&lt;=, &lt;, &gt;=, &gt; </code>and<code> ==</code>)
are supported between the variables. </p>
<p>Boolean
    operations such as <code>&amp;&amp;, ||, ! and ^</code> can also be performed
  on all symbol types.</p>
<p>Integers behave the same as strings when it comes to boolean
  operations. However, they are compared as true integers and can be used for
  such tasks as preprocessing code where various screen resolutions require different
images that are optimized for different resolutions. For example, the directive </p>
<p><code>//#if ScreenWidth&gt;100 &amp;&amp; ScreenHeight&gt;120</code> </p>
<p>can specify a code block which will import images only for devices whose screens
  are larger than 100x120.</p>
<p>If a variable is defined, then it is considered
  a boolean with the value, &quot;true.&quot; If the variable is not defined anywhere as
  an ability or configuration. 
  then it is considered a
  boolean with
  value &quot;false.&quot;</p>
<p>Comparisons should not be done on different variable types. However, such
  comparisons do not break the build process. If different variable types are
  compared, the preprocessor issues a warning in the Editor and Output windows,
and evaluates the expressions as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Left and right sides of the comparison operation are of different
      types.    <br>
    Both sides are considered strings and compared lexically, with the exception
      of the @ operation where the &quot;subset&quot; relationship operation
      will still be performed (allowing you to check whether a certain integer
      is in
      a particular set). </li>
  <li>One of the variables is not defined or is defined as a boolean
      symbol.    <br>
    The variable is considered an empty string &quot;&quot;. If one of the
      variables is integer it is also converted to a string and a lexical comparison
      will
      take place. . </li>
</ul>

<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>There are three types of operators with different priorities: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The &quot;not&quot; operator (!)
    <p>This operator has the highest priority and can be used on variables and
            expressions with the syntax <code>!&lt;identifier&gt; </code>or<code> !&lt;expression&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>For example, <code>//#if !(ScreenWidth&gt;100 &amp;&amp; ScreenHeight&gt;120)</code> 
      checks if the screen size is smaller than 100x120. </p>
    <p> Since the <code>!</code> operator has the highest priority, expressions 
      such as<code> //#if !ScreenSize==&quot;100x200&quot;</code> are illegal and 
      yield syntax errors because a boolean result cannot be compared to a string.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Comparison operators
    <p>Comparison operators have the second highest priority and perform typical
                comparison operations. Because the operators can compare strings
      lexically and integers mathematically, cross-type
                    comparisons are supported. However, they can be used only in
      expressions and should compare two variables, not
              symbols.</p>
    <p>There is also a special comparison operator which performs a &quot;subset&quot; relationship
              operation. This operator is denoted by the character <code>@</code>.
              Both left and right arguments should be strings which represent two
              sets of
              tokens
            delimited
            by specific
              delimiters. The operator first considers both left and right string
              arguments as sets and then determines if the set from the left argument
              is a subset
              of
            the set
              from the right argument. The valid word delimiters are<code> &lt;whitespace&gt;,','
              </code>and<code> ';'</code>. The delimiters can be mixed arbitralily
          within each argument, as shown in the following examples. </p>
    <p><code>&quot;gif&quot; @ &quot;gif86, jpeg, gifaboo&quot; = false</code></p>
    <p><code>&quot;gif&quot; @ &quot;gif gif86 jpeg&quot; = true</code></p>
    <p><code>&quot;1 2 4;7,8&quot; @ &quot;0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9&quot; = true</code></p>
    <p><code>&quot;3 5 7 11 13&quot; @ &quot;0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9&quot; = false</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Boolean operators
    <p>Boolean operators have the lowest priority relative to the rest of the
                    operators. They also have different priorities amongst each other,
            just as in the Java language. Boolean operators perform typical logical
            operations such as <code>&amp;&amp;,
                    || </code>and<code> ^</code> on boolean expression results, or
                    check for variable definitions and then
                      treat those as
                      boolean expressions as well. Boolean operators are processed
                in the order: </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>&amp;&amp;</code> </li>
      <li> ^ </li>
      <li>|| </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
