    <h2>CDC Project Properties Dialog Box: Compiling </h2>
    <p>The Compiling  panel enables you to set general compilation options for your project.

    <p>In the Compiling options page, you can set the following properties:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Generate Debugging Info.</b> The compiler will include information neccessary for debugging
        in the compiled class files.</li>
        <li><b>Report Uses of Deprecated APIs.</b>During the compilation process you will be informed about
        places in your code where you are calling/using obsolete API.</li>
    </ul>
