  provides the following services: </p>

    devices, either through a serial cable connected to a PC, or remotely through
    the internet.</li>
  <li>Provides system resources such as (Connected, Limited Device Connection)
    (CLDC) classes, MIDP classes, and the KVM. AMS also makes all the classes
    resource files,
    and
    Java Application
    Descriptor
    files available to the MIDlet at runtime.</li>
  <li>Handles installation and runtime errors.</li>
