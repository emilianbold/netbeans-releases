        <h2>Java Platform Manager Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>The Java Platform Manager is a tool for registering different versions of
        the Java Development Kit (JDK) and other Java tools that your programs depend
        on. The  dialog box lists all of your registered JDKs and SDKs
        in the left pane.  It also lists the JDK that the IDE is running on as the Default
        Platform.
        <p>You can open the dialog box by choosing Tools &gt; Java Platform Manager. 
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li> You can  set the IDE's default platform by running the IDE with
            the <tt>--jdkhome</tt> 
            switch on the command line or by entering the path to the JDK in the <tt>netbeans_jdkhome</tt> 
            property of your <tt><i>INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY</i>/etc/netbeans.conf</tt> 
            file.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using the Java Platform Manager, you can: 
        <ul>
            <li>Register a new JDK. Directories that contain JDKs
            are marked with an <img src="../../images/platform.gif" width="18" height="16" alt="platform directory">&nbsp;icon
            in the file chooser. </li>
            <li>View registered JDK's classpaths.</li>
            <li>Register source code for a JDK in the Sources tab.</li>
            <li>Register Javadoc documentation for a JDK in the  Javadoc tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have registered a JDK, you can configure a standard project to use
        that JDK for compilation, execution, and debugging. Go to the project's Project
        Properties dialog box, select the Libraries node, and choose the appropriate
        JDK in the Java Platform combo box. 
        <p><b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>For CDC projects, you can add emulator and SDK platforms for mobile
            and PDA devices.  For more information, see
