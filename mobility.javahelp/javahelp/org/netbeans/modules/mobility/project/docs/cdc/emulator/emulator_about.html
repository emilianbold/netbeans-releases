<h2>About CDC Emulator Platforms</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>An emulator platform simulates the execution of an application on one or more 
  target devices. For example, the Sun Java Toolkit for CDC enables you to run 
  applications on several example devices, or &quot;skins&quot; included with 
  the emulator. An emulator allows you to understand the user experience for an 
  application on a particular device, and to test the portability of the application 
  across different devices. </p>
<p>In the IDE, you specify the emulator platform in the project properties. Many 
  emulator platforms are packaged as software developer kits (SDKs) from manufacturers 
  of mobile devices. </p>
<p> Some of the differences between emulators include their support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>profiles.</li>
  <li>devices, or &quot;skins.&quot;</li>
  <li>optional packages and APIs.</li>
  <li>monitoring and testing tools.</li>
</ul>
  <p>Note that having an emulator does not completely free you from testing on your 
  target devices. An emulator can only approximate a device's user interface, 
  functionality, and performance. For example, an emulator might not simulate 
  processing speed, so an application may run faster or slower on a target device 
  than it does on an emulator.</p>
