    <h2>New CDC Application Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
    <p>The New CDC Project with Existing Sources wizard enables you to create a
    new project from an existing CDC source folder. You open the wizard by 
    opening the New Project wizard and selecting the 
    CDC Application with Existing Sources template from the CDC category. 
    <p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following properties: 
    
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name. </b>Specifies the display name of the project. This name 
    is also used to create the project folder.</li>
  <li><b>Project Location. </b>Specifies the folder where you want to store the 
    project metadata and source code. When you create an empty Java project, you 
    cannot store the project folder and the project source code in separate locations 
    like you can with projects from existing source code.</li>
  <li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the main project.</li>
  <li><b>Create Main Class.</b> Specifies the package and name of the main class. 
    You should enter the fully qualified name of the class without the <tt>.java 
    </tt>extension (for example, <tt>com.me.MyClass</tt>).</li>
  <li><b>Application UID.</b> Specifies or generates unique digital inprint for 
    your CDC application. For more information please see 
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
      <param name="content" value="https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/uidfaq">
      <param name="text" value="<html><u>Symbian Signed</u></html>">
      <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
      <param name="textColor" value="blue">
    </object>
  </li>
  <li><b>Application Name.</b> Specifies the display name of the application on 
    the target device.</li>
</ul>
    <p>When you click Finish, the project is created on your computer and opened in 
    both the Projects window and the Files window. </p>
    <p>When you click Next, you will be able to add folders with existing sources</p>
    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each CDC Project with Existing Sources can only contain one source packages 
        folder and its corresponding test packages folder. To work with multiple source 
        folders, you have to create a separate project for each source folder and 
        create build dependencies between the projects.</li>
    </ul>
