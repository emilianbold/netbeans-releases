<h2>About JMunit</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>The IDE provides built-in JMUnit support for generating and executing unit 
  tests for JME, CLDC/MIDP applications. JMUnit is an open source product, based 
  on JUNIT, that supports development of tests and provides a harness for running 
  these tests. 
<p>For more information about JMUnit, see:</p>

<h3>Test Types in the IDE</h3>
<p>You can use the IDE to create the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Empty Tests</b>. Test skeletons without testing methods, for which no 
    class has been designated to be tested. </li>
  <li><b>Tests for Existing Classes</b><strong> and Methods.</strong> Classes 
    containing the actual testing methods which mirror the structure of the sources 
    being tested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The IDE cannot create unit tests with JMunit for MIDlet classes or private 
    methods at this time. </p>
<h3>JMUnit Test Structure</h3>
<p>The IDE represents unit tests as subtrees which mirror the project's Java package 
  structure. Each test class has the name of the class it is testing appended 
  by the word Test (for example, <tt>MyClassTest.java</tt>).</p>
<p>Each standard project has a default test folder that is used to store your 
  tests. This folder is displayed as the Test Packages node in the Projects window. 
  You can add any number of test folders to your project. Test files must be located 
  in a separate source tree than the source files they test.</p>
<h3>Running JMunit Tests</h3>
<p>You can generate and navigate to tests by selecting any class or package node 
  in the Projects window and choosing from the Tools &gt; JUnit menu.</p>
<p>When you generate your first test, a TestRunner MIDlet from the framework JAR 
  gets added to the list of MIDlets This MIDlet will be shown in the emulator 
  window&acute;s Run list when you run the project. </p>
<p>All test classes are added to a property in the JAD manifest called 
    JMunitTestClasses. When you generate your first test for the project, the JMunit 
  framework JAR gets added to the project libraries for all project configurations. The framework JAR builds a list of tests to run from the JMunittestClasses property.<br>
