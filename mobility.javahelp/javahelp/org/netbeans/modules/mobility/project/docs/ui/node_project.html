<h2>Mobility Project Node</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Mobility Project node in the Projects window (<img src="../images/mobilitynode.gif" width="12" height="17">) 
  provides a logical view of a mobile application in the Projects window. The 
  logical view of the project, shown in the Projects window, provides a hierarchy 
  of sources and resources which reflects the type of project and its contents. 
</p>
<p>By right-clicking on the project node, you can choose the following Mobility-specific 
  menu items: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Batch Build.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then builds a distribution JAR for each configuration 
    you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Clean &amp; Build.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select 
    multiple configurations. The IDE then cleans and builds a distribution JAR 
    file for each configuration you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Clean.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then cleans the build files for each configuration 
    you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Deploy.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then <a href="../deploy/about_deployment.html">deploys</a> 
    your application according to the deployment properties set in each configuration 
    you select.</li>
  <li><strong>Run With.</strong> Opens the Quick Project Run dialog. In this dialog, 
    you can select a device &quot;on the fly&quot; on which to test your application. 
    The IDE runs your application on the selected platform, but does not build 
    the project or create a distribution JAR for that platform. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Source Packages node encapsulates all the Java packages of the project. 
  Right-clicking on the Source Package node and choosing New lets you add new 
  <a href="../projects/proj_templates.html">file templates</a> to your application. 
</p>
<p>The Resources node encapsulates all resources and libraries of the active configuration. 
  The IDE notifies you through a note on the node if the active configuration 
  inherits resources and libraries from <code>DefaultConfiguration</code>. </p>
<p>Right-clicking the Resources node enables you to add Project, JARs, folders, 
  and libraries as resources for your application. You can not add or remove inherited 
  resources. </p>
<p>Right-clicking on the Project Configurations node opens the Add Configuration 
  wizard, which enables you to create new configurations for your project. </p>
