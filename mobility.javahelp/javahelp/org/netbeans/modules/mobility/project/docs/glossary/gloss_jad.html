<h6>Java Application Descriptor (JAD)</h6>
<p>The Java Application Descriptor File (JAD) contains header information for
  a MIDlet suite, such as the company that developed the application, application
  name, and size. When an application is downloaded to a device, the descriptor
  is downloaded and read before the JAR file that contains the MIDP application.
  This enables the device to confirm that space exists for the application, and
confirms that the full application should be downloaded. </p>
<p>Java Application Descriptor
  Files have the extension <tt>.jad</tt>. </p>
