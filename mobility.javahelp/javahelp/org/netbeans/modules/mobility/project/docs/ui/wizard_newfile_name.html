<h2>New MIDP File Wizard:<br>
Name and Location Page</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You open the New MIDP File wizard by choosing File &gt; New File and selecting 
  a file from the MIDP category. You use this page of the wizard to specify the 
  name of the MIDP class and its location within a project.</p>
<p>In the Name and Location page, you set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MIDP Class Name.</strong> The name of the new MIDP class. <br>
    Note that there cannot be two classes with identical names within the same 
    project. </li>
  <li><strong>Project. </strong>Shows the name of the project selected in the 
    previous step. This field is not editable. </li>
  <li><strong>Package. </strong>Specifies the location of the MIDlet class. You 
    can select an existing package from the Combo Box, or type in the name of 
    a new package. The new package is created along with the class. </li>
  <li><strong>Created File.</strong> Shows the name and location of the file when 
    it is created. This field is not editable. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating a new MIDlet, you can also set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MIDlet Class Name. </strong>The displayable name that users see 
    when the application is run on a mobile device.</li>
  <li><strong>MIDlet Icon.</strong> An icon that is associated with the MIDlet.
  Users see this icon when the MIDlet is run on a mobile device.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
  <li>When a new MIDlet is created, the IDE automatically
      adds the MIDlet to the <a href="../properties/jad_about.html">Application
      Descriptor</a> file. </li>
  </ul>
