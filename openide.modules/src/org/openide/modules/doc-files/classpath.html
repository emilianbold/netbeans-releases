  <h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>
   NetBeans, as a large Java application with a sophisticated module system and a
   strong framework for maintaining inter-module compatibility, has a specialized
   infrastructure for physically loading the classes that produce the
   application. It uses <em>class loaders</em> to manage the interactions between
   modules.
  </p>
  <p>
   While developers who are accustomed to working with application servers or
   other large componentized applications might already be familiar with the
   purposes and basic mechanisms of class loader partitioning, many Java
   developers only have experience with monolithic applications loaded entirely
   from the system <em>class path</em> (the <code>-classpath</code> parameter to
   the Java VM launcher). All developers seeking to write a NetBeans module
   should have some practical understanding of how NetBeans manages class
   loading.
  </p>
  <p>
   This document attempts to explain the basic system by which classes are loaded
   into NetBeans; and how you as a module author can take advantage of the power
   this system offers, without becoming a victim to some common misperceptions
   and mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Everything written here is <em>nonnormative</em>, which is to say it is not a
   formal part of the Modules API specification. For precise guarantees as to
   what you can and cannot do, as well as details on several points of manifest
   syntax, please read the
   <a href="api.html">Modules API</a>.
  </p>

  <h1><a name="loader-hier">The Class Loader Hierarchy</a></h1>

  <p>
   The basic thing you need to understand about how modules control class loading
   is this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <em>
     If module B has a declared dependency on module A, then classes in B can
     refer to classes in A (but A cannot refer to B). If
     B does not have a declared dependency on A, it cannot refer to A.
     Furthermore, dependencies are not considered transitive for purposes of
     classloading: if C has a declared dependency on B, it can refer to classes in
     B, but not to A (unless it also declares an explicit dependency on A).
    </em>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Remember: <em>refer to</em> here means <em>refer to statically</em>: compile
   and link against. Source code for B should be passed the JAR for A in its
   classpath when compiling. Module A can certainly use objects created by module
   B, if assigned to a suitably generic interface; it just cannot link against
   these specific classes in Java source code.
   The same system applies to classpath-oriented calls such as
   <code>Class.getResource(String&nbsp;path)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
   This constraint is enforced using the parent-child relationship of <em>class
   loaders</em>. Each module has its own dedicated class loader. A NetBeans
   module classloader delegates only to the classloaders of modules which the
   module author asked to depend on.
  </p>
  <p>
   This kind of relationship - a hierarchy of classloaders - is common in
   componentized Java applications. NetBeans takes the concept a little bit
   further: since a module can (and very often will) depend on several other
   modules, the classloader hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph, rather than a
   tree. This could be called multiple inheritance of classloaders.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are a number of reasons for using such a system, rather than dumping
   everything in one big classpath. The main reason, though, is safety. If
   NetBeans let you use any class from any other module, you might begin relying
   on another module without even realizing it. This could cause sudden errors if
   that other module were missing from a user's installation. Declaring a module
   dependency prevents such a situation from arising.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is a trivial summary of the situation:
  </p>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.a
  </pre>
<pre>
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">abstract</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">A</span> {<span class="comment">/* ... */</span>}
<span class="comment">// ...
</span><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">useSomeA</span>(A a) {<span class="comment">/* ... */</span>}
</pre>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.b
OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.netbeans.modules.a
  </pre>
<pre>
<span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="type">B</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> A {<span class="comment">/* ... */</span>}
<span class="comment">// ...
</span>useSomeA(<span class="keyword">new</span> B());
</pre>
  <p>
   This basic rule covers the bulk of the situations you will encounter. There
   are some further reasons why you might not be able to access certain classes,
   but you can probably stop reading now unless you actually run into problems.
   <!--
   Use of the <code>Class-Path</code> tag described in the next section is the
   most common way to make classes available other than simple module
   dependencies.
   -->
  </p>

  <h2><a name="class-path">Extensions using <code>Class-Path</code></a></h2>

  <p>
   Commonly a NetBeans module will serve as a wrapper for an independent library,
   or will use one or more separate libraries as part of its implementation or
   API. Forcing all classes and resources used by a module to be packed together
   into the module JAR is generally undesirable for reasons of maintenance and
   clarity. Sometimes it may even violate license terms of a library to modify it
   by repackaging it into a module JAR.
  </p>
  <p>
   NetBeans handles this situation by letting you use the <code>Class-Path</code>
   manifest attribute defined by the

   <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html#bundled">Java Extension Mechanism</a>.

   The value of the attribute consists of one or more relative paths to library
   JARs, in the same directory as the module or (normally) beneath it.
   Conventionally, such extensions are placed in a directory named
   <samp>ext/</samp> beneath the directory where the module is. It is a good idea
   to name extension JARs precisely (i.e., include the version number).
  </p>
  <p>
   For example, a module <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/module.jar</samp> would
   refer to the extensions
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/ext/library-a-1.0.jar</samp> and
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/ext/library-b-1.1.jar</samp> this way:
  </p>
  <pre>
Class-Path: ext/library-a-1.0.jar ext/library-b-1.1.jar
  </pre>
  <p>
   When you do this, the libraries are loaded from the same classloader as the
   main module JAR, just as if they had been unpacked and physically added to it.
   Classes from any of these JARs can refer to classes in the others. As a matter
   of style, however, you should generally refer to the libraries from the module
   but not refer to the module from the libraries. Modules dependent on a module
   with extensions can refer to its extensions too.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is common for a module to just be a <em>wrapper</em> which has no classes
   itself, but merely refers to a library using <code>Class-Path</code>. Creating
   such a wrapper module blesses the library with the flexible deployment and
   maintenance qualities of a module. If there is no legal reason not to, you can
   also just insert NetBeans-specific manifest attributes in <em>any</em> JAR and
   use it as a module, without interfering with its use outside NetBeans.
  </p>
  <p>
   Overuse of <code>Class-Path</code> is a common bad habit. Use module
   dependencies to express relationships between independent blocks of code;
   <code>Class-Path</code> should be used only when a JAR is a wholly owned part
   of a module.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>Never</strong> refer to the same JAR using <code>Class-Path</code>
   from two different modules. (It will get loaded <em>twice</em> and could cause
   strange problems.) If you think you need to, generally this just means you
   have not factored out your module dependencies thoroughly: split off a third
   module to hold the library.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>Never</strong> try to use <code>Class-Path</code> to refer to other
   module JARs, or to JARs in the NetBeans <samp>lib/</samp> directory, or
   generally to any JAR you did not specifically bundle alongside your module and
   your module only (for example, in an NBM package for Auto Update).
  </p>
  <p>
   Do not be alarmed by all the "never"s; these are good guidelines to protect
   you from common design mistakes, but the basic behavior of
   <code>Class-Path</code> is pretty simple:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <em>
     If a module A has a <code>Class-Path</code> attribute listing some relative
     JAR paths, the effect is exactly the same as if the contents of those JARs
     were just copied into A's main JAR.
    </em>
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="libs">Startup Libraries</a></h2>

  <p>
   In a given NetBeans release, there are several libraries placed in the
   <samp>lib/</samp> and <samp>lib/ext/</samp> subdirectories of the NetBeans
   installation. These are referred to as <em>startup libraries</em>. They fall
   into a few categories in regard to how they may be used by modules.
  </p>

  <dl>

   <dt>API Libraries</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>
     <samp>lib/openide.jar</samp> holds the NetBeans Open APIs. All modules may
     use public classes in this JAR without doing anything special. The manifest
     tag <code>OpenIDE-Module-IDE-Dependencies</code> permits a module to request
     a specific <em>version</em> of the APIs and should always be used and kept
     current (i.e. request the oldest version of the APIs with which your module
     can run).
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>The Core</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>
     <samp>lib/core*.jar</samp> and <samp>lib/ext/boot.jar</samp> contain various
     pieces of the NetBeans core implementation. These are <em>not</em> available
     for use by modules. A handful of NetBeans modules have special reasons to
     interact directly with the core - for example, Auto Update sometimes needs
     to cooperate with it in order to install new modules - but the mechanisms
     for gaining access to core classes are not supported (subject to change
     without notice).
    </p>
    <p>
     <samp>lib/updater.jar</samp> is used only by the Auto Update module, and is
     not accessible to other modules.
    </p>
   </dd>

  </dl>

  <h2><a name="patches-l10n">Patches and Localizations</a></h2>

  <p>
   In addition to use of <code>Class-Path</code>, there are a couple of other
   ways in which additional JARs might be added into the classloader for a
   module.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>Patches</em> are JARs which may replace classes and resources in a module
   classloader. If a module has the code name base <samp>a.b.c</samp>, and there
   is a subdirectory named <samp>patches/a-b-c/</samp> beneath the directory in
   which the module JAR resides, then this patch area will be scanned for JAR
   files to be added to the "front" of the module classloader - anything found in
   them will override corresponding classes or resources in the module and its
   extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
   This patching facility is occasionally useful for testing modifications to
   installed modules, or making emergency fixes in the field, without needing to
   touch the master copy of the module. Modules should not be shipped with any
   patches, however.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>Localization and branding</em> may also affect the module classloader. A
   module may load resources (such as property bundles, images, XML layers, and
   so on) using the recommended internationalized lookup techniques -
   <code>NbBundle</code> methods, the <code>nbresloc:</code> URL protocol, and so
   on. Actual localizations of these resources are best placed in separate JAR
   files, which must be named according to the locale and placed in a
   subdirectory named <samp>locale/</samp> beneath the directory in which the
   module JAR resides. For example, a Japanese localization of a module
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/module.jar</samp> would be named
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/locale/module_ja.jar</samp>.
  </p>
  <p>
   Analogously, a module may be <em>branded</em> to adjust it to use in a
   specific product, using essentially the same mechanism. The module just
   mentioned could have a few text changes made for a product branding named
   <samp>myapp</samp> by creating a file named
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/locale/module_myapp.jar</samp>. Locales and
   brandings are orthogonal, so a Belgian French translation of text strings
   specific to MyApp Community Edition might be kept in
   <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/locale/module_myapp_ce_fr_BE.jar</samp>.
  </p>
  <p>
   All applicable locale and branding variants of module JARs are placed in the
   same classloader as the module itself. Only variant JARs which actually apply
   at runtime (according to the current locale and branding) will be loaded.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="special-modules">Eager and Autoload Modules, Test-Mode Modules, and Manually Installed Modules</a></h2>

  <p>
   While in many cases, modules live in the <samp><i>$NBHOME</i>/modules/</samp>
   directory, or the matching <samp><i>$NBUSER</i>/modules/</samp> part of the
   user directory, this is not always true, and it is worth mentioning how the
   location of a module defines the locations of associated JARs.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <em>
     Extensions using <code>Class-Path</code>, patches, and locale and branding
     variants of a module are always located relative to the actual position of
     the module JAR, wherever that might be.
    </em>
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   The user of a NetBeans installation has the option of installing a module JAR
   from any location on disk. Therefore, any extensions or locale variants must
   be found in corresponding locations, <em>not</em> inside the NetBeans
   installation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Developers of NetBeans modules can additionally install them in <em>test
   mode</em>, where they are loaded in such a way that it is safe to reload them
   after making changes. (Currently this involves making a temporary copy of the
   JAR which is loaded in its stead.) Again, any extensions must be found
   relative to the actual position of the JAR, not placed in the NetBeans
   installation. <strong>Note:</strong> reloading a test module will generally
   <em>not</em> reload its extensions too. If you need to test changes to a
   module's extensions as well as the module itself, it is recommended that the
   test-mode JAR be built with all extension classes and resources directly
   included; the extensions can still be kept in separate JARs at production
   time.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="prov-req">Provide-Require Dependencies</a></h2>

  <p>
   In addition to regular dependencies using
   <code>OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies</code>, modules can also depend on
   the existence of other modules using <em>provide-require</em> dependencies.
   Here, one or more modules provide some arbitrary token (often the name of an
   API class for which they supply implementations in Lookup); and other modules
   may request that this token be available. A requesting modules can be enabled
   only when at least one (perhaps more) providing module is enabled.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <em>
     Provide-require dependencies have no effect on classloading. If module A
     provides token T, and module B requires token T, B may not refer to classes
     in A (unless it additionally declares a regular dependency on A).
    </em>
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="public-packages">Dependencies and Package Restrictions</a></h2>

  <p>
   By default when a module B declares a direct dependency on another module A,
   then B can access any public (or, as appropriate, protected) class in A - i.e.
   all of A is "in its classpath". However it is often the case that such broad
   access is undesirable. Module A may provide a formal API in certain packages,
   and use other packages for its private implementation. In this case it would
   not want other modules freely using its undocumented implementation classes.
  </p>
  <p>
   For this reason, a special manifest attribute
   <code>OpenIDE-Module-Public-Packages</code> can be specified in A:
  </p>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.a
OpenIDE-Module-Specification-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module-Implementation-Version: 1.0-alpha-2
OpenIDE-Module-Public-Packages: org.netbeans.api.a.**, org.netbeans.spi.a.**
  </pre>
  <p>
   This attribute tells the NetBeans module system to limit which packages from A
   are considered part of its API. If B declares a regular dependency on A
   according to its public API specification version:
  </p>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.b
OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.netbeans.modules.a > 1.0
  </pre>
  <p>
   then B can only use some packages from A: here,
   <code>org.netbeans.api.a</code> (and any subpackages it may have) and
   <code>org.netbeans.spi.a</code> (and subpackages). Module B will <em>not</em>
   be permitted to use other packages from A, such as
   <code>org.netbeans.modules.a</code>; attempts to do so will just result in a
   <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> when loading code from B.
  </p>
  <p>
   This manifest goes further and prevents <em>any</em> packages from being
   available to other modules:
  </p>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.a
OpenIDE-Module-Public-Packages: -
  </pre>
  <p>
   You may still declare a dependency on such a module, in order to ensure that
   it is installed (perhaps it provides some non-Java-level service you need),
   but you may not import any classes from it.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a limited "back door" to this package restriction: if module B
   declares that it knows about module A's internal implementation, and is
   prepared to track arbitrary changes in A, then it can use any public classes
   from A regardless of the public package declaration. This is done using an
   implementation dependency:
  </p>
  <pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
OpenIDE-Module: org.netbeans.modules.b
OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.netbeans.modules.a = 1.0-alpha-2
  </pre>
  <p>
   Here module B declares that it is written to match details of A's
   implementation classes at that point in time. This version of B may not use
   <em>any earlier or later</em> versions of A, since there is no telling what
   changes to A's implementation classes there might have been. Therefore, such
   implementation dependencies are usually used among "friend modules" which are
   updated and published in clusters by a single developer or team.
  </p>
  <p>
   Again, dependencies are not considered transitive for purposes of class
   loading; so package visibility from module A to module C (where C depends on
   B) is entirely independent of visibility from A to B - it can be computed
   entirely from the manifests of A and C.
  </p>
  <p>
   Public package declarations also apply to packages contained in
   <code>Class-Path</code> extensions - just as if those classes were in the main
   module JAR.
  </p>
  <p>
   In summary:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <em>
     If module A declares that it has a particular list of public packages, and
     module B declares a direct dependency on A, B can always use classes from
     A's public packages (if any). B may only use undeclared packages from A
     (implementation classes) if it declares an implementation dependency on the
     exact version of A.
    </em>
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h1><a name="syscl">The System Class Loader, Thread Context Class Loading, and <code>nbres:</code></a></h1>

  <p>
   There is a special class loader in NetBeans referred to as the <em>system
   class loader</em>. This loader can load classes from any enabled module, as
   well as the JRE/JDK and all <a href="#libs">startup libraries</a> (APIs and core).
   Therefore it is useful as a default class
   loader to be used by any code which tries to find a class by name without
   specific knowledge of where it may be located.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finding the system class loader is easy using lookup:
  </p>
  <pre>
<span class="type">ClassLoader</span> <span class="variable-name">syscl</span> = (<span class="type">ClassLoader</span>)Lookup.getDefault().lookup(ClassLoader.<span class="keyword">class</span>);
  </pre>
  <p>
   This class loader is also the
   <a href="@JDK@/java/lang/Thread.html#getContextClassLoader()">context class loader</a>
   for every thread in the NetBeans VM, unless that thread (or a parent)
   explicitly set some other context class loader. Since many libraries which are
   independent of NetBeans (including in the JRE) are written to assume that all
   relevant classes can be loaded by name from the current thread's context loader,
   it is very useful for this loader to be the system class loader - you can specify
   any class in your module by name.
  </p>
  <p>
   (More helpful information: <a
   href="http://www.javageeks.com/Papers/ClassForName/ClassForName.pdf">Understanding
   <code>Class.forName()</code></a>)
  </p>
  <pre>
<span class="type">ClassLoader</span> <span class="variable-name">l</span> = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
<span class="type">Class</span> <span class="variable-name">c</span> = l.loadClass(<span class="string">"some.module.Class"</span>);
  </pre>
  <p>
   Any module class can be accessed from this loader, regardless of any
   <code>OpenIDE-Module-Public-Packages</code> declarations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The system loader always represents the contents of the enabled modules in
   NetBeans. If a module is newly enabled at runtime, its classes are effectively
   added to the namespace of the <em>same</em> system <code>ClassLoader</code>
   instance. (Note that this means that a call to <code>Class.forName</code>
   which fails before the module is enabled may succeed afterwards.) However, if
   a module is <em>disabled</em> at runtime, the system class loader is
   <em>reset</em> to a new loader which does not have access to the old module.
   This is necessary because it is impossible to remove classes from a loader
   once they have been loaded. After a module is disabled and the loader reset, a
   saved <code>Lookup.Result</code> query on <code>ClassLoader</code> will fire a
   lookup result change, and all threads will be updated to get the new context
   class loader too.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is often useful to be able to refer to <em>resources</em> other than
   classes in the system class loader. This is easy to do because NetBeans
   defines a special URL protocol handler for just this purpose. URLs with the
   <code>nbres</code> protocol refer to resources in the system loader, and thus
   can refer to resources present in any module JAR. This is very useful when
   some declarative syntax requires a URL that should look in a module; for
   example:
  </p>

   There is also a related protocol <code>nbresloc</code> which loads from the
   system class loader but additionally performs automatic localization and
   branding of the resource you specify. Various
   <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/NbBundle.html#getLocalizingSuffixes()">suffixes</a>
   are inserted between the base name and the extension of the resource
   (beginning with the last dot in the path, if it is in the last path
   component), according to the current locale and branding. For example:
  </p>
  <pre>
&lt;?<span class="keyword">xml</span> <span class="variable-name">version</span>=<span class="string">"1.0"</span> <span class="variable-name">encoding</span>=<span class="string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;

   Here NetBeans will look for the most specific applicable icon; it might for
   example find <samp>org/netbeans/modules/url/webLink_ja.gif</samp> in
   <samp>modules/locale/utilities_ja.jar</samp>, if Japanese localizers decided
   the default icon was not intuitive for Japanese users and made a replacement.
   Whenever you are asked for a URL to a displayable resource, consider using
   <code>nbresloc</code> in place of <code>nbres</code>.

  <p>
   This section is an attempt to gather a number of the problems, questions, and
   misperceptions that people using the NetBeans module system have run across.
   In some cases an error is caused by a simple mistake that can be corrected
   just as simply; in other cases, you may need to consider the design of your
   module and how it can work smoothly in NetBeans.
  </p>

  <h2>I am confused by the difference between the module "class path" and the <b>Filesystems</b> tab in the Explorer</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>My module seems to run, but there is a warning message in the log file</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>My module compiles, but throws <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> when I run it</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I get a <code>ClassCastException</code>, but the "incorrect class" is actually the one I cast to</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>My module stopped working after I ran an obfuscator on it</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I can only load some classes in a certain package that I have in two modules</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2><a name="default_package">I am getting warnings when trying to access resources from the default (root, unnamed) package</a></h2>

  <p>Loading classes from the default (root) package is disabled. You can load resources from
     that package but a warning is printed. It is strongly discouraged to use the default package.
     Please see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/packages.doc.html#40169">
     Java Language Specification </a> for more details.
     You can suppress the warning using <code>-J-Dorg.netbeans.ProxyClassLoader.level=1000</code> command
     line switch.

  <h2>I tried to override a common library with my own version but I get the wrong copy of classes</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I have a dependency on another module but still cannot access any/some classes in it</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>Patching someone else's module using <samp>lib/patches/</samp> gave me errors</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I am trying to use internal execution and I get a strange warning in the status bar</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I used <code>Class-Path</code> from my autoload module but it has no effect</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2><code>Class-Path</code> works in my module if I install it normally, but not in test mode</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I want two or more of my modules to be able to refer to each other, but they cannot both do so</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>A little bit of one of my modules depends on another, but I do not want a dependency just for this</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I need to supply two different versions of the same library</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I made my own <code>ClassLoader</code> and now I just get <code>SecurityException</code>s when I try to use it</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>Users ought to be able to add JARs to my module's class path to extend it</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>Users should be able to compile and/or run their own apps with some of my JARs in the class path</h2>

  <p><strong>XXX</strong></p>

  <h2>I would like to use <samp>%CLASSPATH%</samp> / <samp>$CLASSPATH</samp></h2>

  <p>NetBeans ignores <samp>%CLASSPATH%</samp> / <samp>$CLASSPATH</samp> environment variables
     and defines its own classpath containing minimal set of classes required to start
     the application using <code>-classpath</code> parameter passed to JVM.
     All other classes are loaded by classloaders created during runtime and briefly described 
     in this document. 
     If it is really neceseary to add more classes or resources to application classloader
     <code>--cp:a</code> or <code>--cp:p</code> options of launcher can be used.
 </p>

  <h2>Using <samp>lib/ext/</samp> or <samp>-cp</samp> sounds much easier but someone told me not to do it</h2>

  <p>The reason is similar to why JDK documentation about setting the class path for
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/classpath.html">Windows</a> or
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/classpath.html">Solaris</a>
     states that <code>-classpath</code> is prefered over environment variables.
     Adding classes (resources) to <samp>lib/ext/</samp> affects all Java applications
     running using this Java installation. 
     Use of <samp>--cp</samp> affects all modules and for example prevents the possibility 
     to have more modules depending on different version of the same library.

  <h2>I need to add a library JAR from outside the NetBeans installation</h2>
  
  <!-- Moved here from the FAQ. -->
  
  <p>
   <b>Q:</b> Can my module add a library JAR to the classpath from outside the
   IDE installation? For example, I have an application called Etch-a-Kvetch for
   modeling customer call response systems, and I want to build a module to
   integrate it into the IDE. The user may already have Etch-a-Kvetch installed
   on their disk, and I want to reuse the <samp>eak.jar</samp> main library JAR
   in my module. It is not present in the IDE's installation directory. Can I add
   it to the IDE's classpath so my module can use it?
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>A:</b> Not easily. You have a few options:
  </p>
  
  <ol>

   <li>
    <p>
     <em>Add an entry to <samp>ide.cfg</samp>.</em> For example:</p>
    
<pre>
-cp:a c:\eak\lib\eak.jar
</pre>

    <p>
     This startup file provides the ability to add classpath entries to the IDE's
     Java invocation.
    </p>

    <p>
     <em>Pros:</em> Adds the library as desired. <em>Cons:</em> Very fragile.
     Assumes that the <samp>ide.cfg</samp> is actually read, which is not
     guaranteed for all platforms. Easy to clobber existing user customizations.
     Dependent on the exact structure of the IDE's <samp>bin/</samp> directory,
     which has changed quite a bit in the past and could change again. Places
     library in startup classpath, whereas it is preferred to have it in the
     module classloader only. Must be done before the IDE starts, requiring some
     kind of manual installation step and making updating your module very
     difficult.
    </p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>
     <em>Duplicate <samp>eak.jar</samp> in <samp>modules/ext/</samp>.</em> That
      is, ship a copy of the required JAR file inside the IDE installation, and
      continue to refer to dynamic resources in the desired external location.
    </p>

    <p>
     <em>Pros:</em> Simple to implement and should be reliable. Version of the
     library shipped can be controlled to match that which the module was
     compiled against, avoiding potential version skew. <em>Cons:</em>
     Impractical when the library is physically very large, or there are
     licensing issues involved in redistributing it. Bugfix upgrades to the
     master library may not be reflected in the IDE's copy.
    </p>

   </li>

   <li>
    <p>
     <em>Partition your module and use a new classloader.</em> In other words:
     logically divide your module into two halves. The first half will form a
     compilation unit depending on the Open APIs and will contain all of the
     classes referred to directly in the module manifest (the installer, data
     loaders, or whatever you have). It should contain one or more interfaces or
     similar constructs which describe what it expects the second half to
     implement. The second half will form a separate compilation unit, depending
     on the first half, possibly the Open APIs, and also <samp>eak.jar</samp>. It
     should contain implementations of the interfaces specified in the first
     half. The first half, at install/restore time (or lazily when any
     functionality is needed) should create a new <code>URLClassLoader</code>
     whose parent should be the first half's classloader, and including as URLs
     the locations of both the second half as a JAR and the library JAR; using
     this classloader, look up the implementation classes by name; create new
     instances of them; cast them to the interface types; and begin using them.
     The second half should probably be placed in a separate JAR file; if not, it
     will be necessary to subclass the dynamic classloader to not delegate class
     loads for the implementation packages to its parent. Either way, it is
     strongly recommended that the build process enforce that the first half
     compile without reference to the second.
    </p>

    <p>
     <em>Pros:</em> Compliant with the Open APIs and reliable. The library JAR
     may be located anywhere at runtime and could even be moved or replaced at
     runtime. <em>Cons:</em> Potentially complex to implement. Some use of
     reflection required, though it should be safe. More complex build and test
     procedure for the module. The partition between the two halves must be
     carefully chosen, especially for large modules, to minimize the complexity
     of the interfaces and push as much implementation as possible to one side or
     the other.
    </p>

     Oyetunde Fadele has kindly posted a detailed explanation of how to use this
     technique in practice: see his message long ago on dev@openide.netbeans.org.
