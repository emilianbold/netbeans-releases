<!-- The root element for window manager properties. Consists of subelements
     for specific properties.
     Atribute "version" is optional versioning attribute, which in fact specifies
     version of this DTD. Attribute is used to perform simple versioning
     without the need to use time-consuming xml validation using this DTD.

<!-- Element "main-window" contains properties of main window.
     "x" gives position of main window on screen on horizontal axis
     left is 0, if value is "center" main window will be centered
     horizontaly
     "y" gives position of main window on screen on vertical axis
     top is 0, if value is "center" main window will be centered
     verticaly
     Note: the "center" values are taken into account for MDI mode only!
     "width" gives absolute width of main window
     "height" gives absolute height of main window
     "relative-width" gives relative width of main window, either width or
     relative-width must be specified
     "relative-height" gives relative width of main window, either height or
     relative height must be specified
     "maximize-if-width-bellow" and 
     "maximize-if-height-bellow" are optional,
     they specify limit on computed absolute width/height, 
     IF min(screen.width, maximize-if-width-bellow) > main-window.width OR 
        min(screen.height, maximize-if-height-bellow) > main-window.height THEN
         IF screen.width > maximize-if-width-bellow AND screen.height > maximize-if-height-bellow THEN
             set main window size to maximize-if-width-bellow, maximize-if-height-bellow
         ELSE
             let window maximized
         ENDIF
     ENDIF
     It is simply to avoid set bounds bigger than screen size (width or height)
