All services support the following parameters:

  thread-count
    Specifies the number of daemon threads. Usage of the daemon threads
    varies for different service types.

    If zero, all relevant tasks are performed on the service thread.

  task-hung-threshold
    Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that a task can execute
    before it is considered "hung". Note that a posted task that has not
    yet started is never considered as hung.

    This attribute is applied only if the thread pool is used
    (the "thread-count" value is positive).

  task-timeout
    Specifies the default timeout value for tasks that can be timed-out
    (e.g. implement the com.tangosol.net.PriorityTask interface), but don't
    explicitly specify the task execution timeout value. The task execution
    time is measured on the server side and does not include the time spent
    waiting in a service [backlog] queue before being started.

    This attribute is applied only if the thread pool is used
    (the "thread-count" value is positive).

  request-timeout
    Specifies the default timeout value for requests that can time-out
    (e.g. implement the com.tangosol.net.PriorityTask interface), but don't
    explicitly specify the request timeout value. The request time is measured
    on the client side as the time elapsed from the moment a request is sent
    for execution to the corresponding server node(s) and includes the
    following: (1) the time it takes to deliver the request to an executing node
    (server); (2) the interval between the time the task is received and placed
    into a service queue until the execution starts; (3) the task execution time;
    (4) the time it takes to deliver a result back to the client.

  guardian-timeout
    Specifies the guardian timeout value to use for guarding the service and any
    dependant threads.  If the guardian-timeout is not specified for a given
    service, the default guardian timeout (as specified by the operational
    config element "service-guardian/timeout-milliseconds") is used.

    An explicitly specified timeout of 0 will prevent the service (and any
    dependant threads) from being guarded.

  member-listener
    Specifies the configuration info for a class that implements the
    com.tangosol.net.MemberListener interface. This implementation
    must have a public default constructor.

The replicated cache service supports the following parameters:

  standard-lease-milliseconds
    Specifies the duration of the standard lease in milliseconds. Once a lease
    has aged past this number of milliseconds, the lock will automatically be
    released. Set this value to zero to specify a lease that never expires.
    The purpose of this setting is to avoid deadlocks or blocks caused by stuck
    threads; the value should be set higher than the longest expected lock
    duration (e.g. higher than a transaction timeout). It's also recommended
    to set this value higher then packet-delivery/timeout-milliseconds value.

  lease-granularity
    Specifies the lease ownership granularity.

    Valid values are "thread" and "member". A value of "thread" means that
    locks are held by a thread that obtained them and can only be released by
    that thread. A value of "member" means that locks are held by a cluster
    node and any thread running on the cluster node that obtained the lock can
    release it.

    Default value is "thread".

  mobile-issues
    Specifies whether or not the lease issues should be transferred to the most
    recent lock holders. Valid values are "true" or "false".

The partitioned cache service supports the following parameters:

  lease-granularity
    Specifies the lease ownership granularity.

    Valid values are "thread" and "member". A value of "thread" means that
    locks are held by a thread that obtained them and can only be released by
    that thread. A value of "member" means that locks are held by a cluster
    node and any thread running on the cluster node that obtained the lock can
    release it.

    Default value is "thread".

  local-storage
    Specifies whether or not this member of the partitioned cache service enables
    the local storage.

    Valid values are "true" or "false". A value of false means that the cluster
    member will not store any of the data locally. A value of true means that
    the cluster member will store its fair share of the data.

    Default value is true.

  partition-count
    Specifies the number of partitions that a partitioned (distributed) cache will
    be "chopped up" into.  Each member running the partitioned cache service that
    has the local-storage option set to true will manage a "fair" (balanced) number
    of partitions.

    The number of partitions should be a prime number and sufficiently large such
    that a given partition is expected to be no larger than 50MB in size.

    Good defaults for example service storage sizes are provided below:

    service storage       parition-count
    _______________       ______________
       100M                    257
         1G                    509
        10G                   2039
        50G                   4093
       100G                   8191

    A list of first 1,000 primes can be found at
    http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/lists/small/1000.txt

    Valid values are positive integers.

    Default value is the value specified in the tangosol-coherence.xml descriptor.

  transfer-threshold
    Specifies the threshold for the primary partition distribution in kilo-bytes.
    When a new node joins the partitioned cache service or when a member of
    the service leaves, the remaining nodes perform a task of partition ownership
    re-distribution. During this process, the existing data gets re-balanced
    along with the ownership information. This parameter indicates a preferred
    message size for data transfer communications. Setting this value lower will
    make the distribution process take longer, but will reduce network bandwidth
    utilization during this activity.

    Default value is 512 (0.5MB).

  backup-count
    Specifies the number of members of the partitioned cache service that hold
    the backup data for each unit of storage in the cache.

    Value of 0 means that in the case of abnormal termination, some portion
    of the data in the cache will be lost. Value of N means that if up to N
    cluster nodes terminate at once, the cache data will be preserved.

    To maintain the partitioned cache of size M, the total memory usage in the
    cluster does not depend on the number of cluster nodes and will be in the
    order of M*(N+1).

    Recommended values are 0, 1 or 2.
    Default value is 0.

  backup-storage/type
    Specifies the type of the storage used to hold the backup data.

    Valid values are "on-heap", "off-heap", "file-mapped", "custom" or "scheme".
    The corresponding implementations classes are
      - java.util.HashMap,
      - com.tangosol.io.nio.BinaryMap using com.tangosol.io.nio.DirectBufferManager,
      - com.tangosol.io.nio.BinaryMap using com.tangosol.io.nio.MappedBufferManager,
      - the class specified by the backup-storage/class-name element,
      - the map returned by the ConfigurableCacheFactory for the scheme referred to
        by the backup-storage/scheme-name element

    The "off-heap" and "file-mapped" options are only available with JDK 1.4 and later.
    Default value is "on-heap".

  backup-storage/initial-size
    Only applicable with the "off-heap" and "file-mapped" types.

    Specifies the initial buffer size in megabytes.

    Valid values are positive integers between 1 and 2048.
    Default value is 1.

  backup-storage/maximum-size
    Only applicable with the "off-heap" and "file-mapped" types.

    Specifies the maximum buffer size in megabytes.

    Valid values are positive integers between 1 and 2048.
    Default value is 1024.

  backup-storage/directory
    Only applicable with the "file-mapped" type.

    Specifies the pathname for the directory to use by
    com.tangosol.io.nio.MappedBufferManager.  If not specified or specifies
    a non-existent directory, a temporary file in the default location is used.

  backup-storage/class-name
    Only applicable with the "custom" type.

    Specifies a class name for the custom storage implementation.
    If the class implements com.tangosol.run.xml.XmlConfigurable interface
    then upon construction the setConfig method is called passing the
    entire "backup-storage" XmlElement.

  backup-storage/scheme-name
    Only applicable with the "scheme" type.

    Specifies a scheme name for the ConfigurableCacheFactory.

  key-associator/class-name
    Specifies a class name that implements
      com.tangosol.net.partition.KeyAssociator interface.
    This implementation must have a public default constructor.

    If this value is not specified,
      com.tangosol.net.partition.DefaultKeyAssociator
    will be used.

  key-partitioning/class-name
    Specifies a class name that implements
      com.tangosol.net.partition.KeyPartitioningStrategy interface.
    This implementation must have a public default constructor.

  partition-listener/class-name
    Specifies a class name that implements
      com.tangosol.net.partition.PartitionListener interface.
    This implementation must have a public default constructor.

The local cache service supports the following parameters:

  lock-enforce
    Specifies whether or not the locking is enforced for put, remove
    and clear operations.

    Valid values are "true" or "false". A value of if true means that
    the locking is enforced for put, remove and clear operations.
    The value of false means that a client is responsible for calling
    lock and unlock explicitly.

  lock-wait
    If locking enforcement is required then this parameter specifies
    the number of milliseconds to continue trying to obtain a lock.

    The value of -1 means that the calling thread will be blocked
    indefinitely until the lock could be obtained.

the following parameters (see java.util.zip.Deflater for details):

  buffer-length
    Valid values are non-negative integers.  Default value is zero.

The interface element specifies the IP address that a multicast Socket
will be bound to. By default the interface of the unicast-listener IP
address is used for the multicast Socket; this option allows the interface
to be specified. Setting this address to "0.0.0.0" will allow the OS
to use the unicast routing table to select the interface automatically.

Note: Regarding networking, the term "interface" is often used to mean "NIC".

WARNING: With rare exception, use of this particular option is strongly
discouraged, as it can lead to a condition known as "partial failure".
Partial failure occurs when some portion of the cluster communication is
working and other cluster communication has failed. Partial failure can
occur when using this option, because the interface (and thus network) used
for multicast traffic can be different from the interface (and thus network)
used for unicast (UDP/IP) and TCP-ring (TCP/IP) traffic. If one interface
(or network) fails, some communication can continue to succeed, while other
communication will fail, which may cause failover to take longer to occur.
Since clustering handles node (and thus interface) failure, it is preferable
to have all communication fail together, and thus the use of this option is
strongly discouraged.

The group threshold is used to determine whether a packet will be sent via
unicast or multicast. It is a percentage value and is in the range of 1%
to 100%. In a cluster of "n" nodes, a particular node sending a packet to
a set of other (i.e. not counting self) destination nodes of size "d" (in
the range of 0 to n-1), the packet will be sent multicast if and only if
the following both hold true:

  1) The packet is being sent over the network to more than one other node:
       (d > 1)

  2) The number of nodes is greater than the threshold:
       (d > (n-1) * (threshold/100))

Setting this value to 1 will allow the implementation to use multicast for
for basically all multi-point traffic. Setting it to 100 will force the
implementation to use unicast for all multi-point traffic except for

The destination element specifies the output device used by the logging system.

Valid values are "stdout", "stderr", "jdk", "log4j", or a file name; the default
is "stderr".

If "jdk" is specified as the destination, Coherence must be run using JDK 1.4
or later; likewise, if "log4j" is specified, the Log4j libraries must be in
the classpath. In both cases, the appropriate logging configuration mechanism
(system properties, property files, etc.) should be used to configure the
JDK/Log4j logging libraries.

<!--
The logger-name element allows to specify a logger name within chosen logging
system that should be used to log Coherence related messages.

<!--
The severity-level element specifies which logged messages will be output to the
log destination.

Valid values are:
  0     only output without a logging severity level specified will be logged
  1     all the above plus errors
  2     all the above plus warnings
  3     all the above plus informational messages
  4..9  all the above plus internal debugging messages (the higher the number, the more the messages)
  -1    no messages

<!ELEMENT severity-level (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The message-format element specifies how messages that have a logging level specified
will be formatted before passing them to the log destination.

The value of the message-format element is static text with the following
replaceable parameters:
  {date}    the date/time format (to a millisecond) at which the message was logged
  {version} the Oracle Coherence exact version and build details
  {level}   the logging severity level of the message
  {thread}  the thread name that logged the message
  {member}  the cluster member id (if the cluster is currently running)
  {text}    the text of the message

Used in: logging-config
-->
<!ELEMENT message-format (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The character-limit element specifies the maximum number of characters that the logger
daemon will process from the message queue before discarding all remaining messages
in the queue. Note that the message that caused the total number of characters to
exceed the maximum will NOT be truncated, and all messages that are discarded will
be summarized by the logging system with a single log entry detailing the number
of messages that were discarded and their total size. The truncation of the logging
is only temporary, since once the queue is processed (emptied), the logger is reset
so that subsequent messages will be logged.

The purpose of this setting is to avoid a situation where logging can itself prevent
recovery from a failing condition. For example, with tight timings, logging can
actually change the timings, causing more failures and probably more logging, which
becomes a vicious cycle. A limit on the logging being done at any one point in time
is a "pressure valve" that prevents such a vicious cycle from occurring. Note that
logging occurs on a dedicated low-priority thread to even further reduce its impact
on the critical portions of the system.

The value is a positive integer or zero. Zero implies no limit.

<!--
The xml-override mechanism allows the content of certain elements be fully
or partially overridden with XML documents that are external to the base
document.  The value of this attribute is the resource name of such an
override document that should be accessible using the
ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String name) by the classes contained
in coherence.jar library.  In general that means that resource name
should be prefixed with '/' and located in the classpath.

The override XML document referred by this attribute does not have to exist.
However, if it does exist then its root element must have the same name as
the element it overrides.

In case when there are multiple elements with the same name (e.g. "service")
the 'id' attribute should be used to identify the base element that will be
overridden as well as the override element itself. The elements of the override
document that do not have a match in the base document are just appended to
the base.
