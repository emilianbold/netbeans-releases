SERVICE_ENGINES_SHORT_DESC=Service Engines are containers that provide services for Business Logic, Processing, transformation, and routing services.
BINDING_COMPONENTS_SHORT_DESC=Binding Components provide a proxy for services in the JBI environment to access remote services requiring a particular protocol. They can also facilitate a remote service consumer to access services in the JBI environment.
SHARED_LIBRARIES_SHORT_DESC=Shared Libraries contain common code shared by multiple JBI container components deployed on the JBI meta-container.
SERVICE_ASSEMBLIES_SHORT_DESC=Service Assemblies are deployment artifacts. Each Service Assemby can package one or more Service Units and defines the target components (Service Engines or Binding Components) to deploy the Service Units to.
