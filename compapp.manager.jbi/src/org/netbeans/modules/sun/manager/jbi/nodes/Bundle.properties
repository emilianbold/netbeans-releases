SERVICE_ENGINES_SHORT_DESC=   <HTML>Service Engines are containers that provide services for Business Logic, <br>Processing, transformation, and routing services.
BINDING_COMPONENTS_SHORT_DESC=<HTML>Binding Components provide a proxy for services in the JBI environment to <br>access remote services requiring a particular protocol. They can also facilitate <br>a remote service consumer to access services in the JBI environment.</HTML>
SHARED_LIBRARIES_SHORT_DESC=  <HTML>Shared Libraries contain common code shared by multiple JBI container components <br>deployed on the JBI meta-container.
SERVICE_ASSEMBLIES_SHORT_DESC=<HTML>Service Assemblies are deployment artifacts. Each Service Assemby can package <br>one or more Service Units and defines the target components (Service Engines or <br>Binding Components) to deploy the Service Units to.
