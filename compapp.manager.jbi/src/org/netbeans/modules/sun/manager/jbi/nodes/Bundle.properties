JBI_SHORT_DESC=JBI meta-container
SERVICE_ENGINES_SHORT_DESC=Service Engines are containers that provide services for Business Logic, Processing, transformation, and routing services.
SERVICE_ENGINE_SHORT_DESC=Service Engine (short desc. here)
BINDING_COMPONENTS_SHORT_DESC=Binding Components provide a proxy for services in the JBI environment to access remote services requiring a particular protocol. They can also facilitate a remote service consumer to access services in the JBI environment.
BINDING_COMPONENT_SHORT_DESC=Binding Component (short desc. here)
SHARED_LIBRARIES_SHORT_DESC=Shared Libraries contain common code shared by multiple JBI container components deployed on the JBI meta-container.
SHARED_LIBRARY_SHORT_DESC=Shared Library (short desc. here)
SERVICE_ASSEMBLIES_SHORT_DESC=Service Assemblies are deployment artifacts. Each Service Assemby can package one or more Service Units and defines the target components (SEs or BCs) to deploy the Service Units to.
SERVICE_ASSEMBLY_SHORT_DESC=Service Assembly (short desc. here)
SERVICE_UNIT_SHORT_DESC=Service Units can be deployed to installed JBI component containers like Binding Components and Service Engines.
