<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Orchestration Designer will support both Process Diagram and BPEL source
file printing. Wherever printing conventions are already in place within
the NetBeans IDE, the Orchestration Designer will follow those
conventions. The Orchestration Designer will also add some particular
user interfaces to address particular issues that apply to diagram
printing and are not covered by existing NetBeans conventions or user
interfaces.

<h2>2. Use Cases and Scenarios</h2>

Scenario:

<ul>
  <li>Diagram is print &quot;target&quot; which means any of the following is true:
    <ul>

          navigator view has focus) and Process Design editor is shown 
      <li>Process Design editor is opened and has focus 
    </ul>
  <li>User invokes the &ldquo;File : Print&rdquo; action
</ul>

    <li>Process node in project explorer is selected (or Process navigator
        view has focus) and Process Design editor isn't shown
  </ul>
  <li>User invokes the &ldquo;File : Print&rdquo; action
</ul>

<H3>UC4: User wants to preview the BPEL source code printout</H3>

        navigator view has focus) and Process Design editor isn't shown
  </ul>

</ul>


<h3>UC5: User wants to print the BPEL source code to HTML</h3>

Scenario:

<ul>
  <li>BPEL source is print &quot;target&quot; which means the following is true:
  <ul>
    <li>Process node in project explorer is selected (or Process
        navigator view has focus

</ul>

<h2>3. Specification</h2>
<H3>File Menu Actions</H3>

<pre>File
   New Project...     Ctrl+Shift+N
   ...
   -----------------
   Page Setup...                        //  Standard Page Setup dialog
   Print...           Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P  //  Print Preview dialog
   Print to HTML...                     //  Printing sources to HTML
   -----------------
   Exit
</pre>

Print to HTML, Print Preview actions are contextual to
a selected node in the Projects View (if it has focus) or active view
in the multiview editor if editor or any other view has focus. In
general, some of the actions may not be implemented for all the views
and in that case they are disabled. Currently, Print to HTML is only
enabled for Source and Print Preview is only enabled for Design
View.

<h3>Print Preview Window</h3>

Print Preview is a modal resizable window. 

<br><br><img src="images/PrintPreview1.png" align=bottom width=558 height=695 border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintPreview2.png" align=bottom width=658 height=877 border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintPreview3.png" align=bottom width=658 height=877 border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintPreview4.png" align=bottom width=658 height=877 border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintPreview5.png" align=bottom width=658 height=877 border=0>

<p><b>Figure - Print Preview Window</b><br>

<i>Note: This is just a mockup; actual icons on the
buttons are defined in the following sections and the
insets should correspond to the guidelines.</i>

<p>Components:
<ul>
  <p><li><b>First Page</b>button - scrolls to the first page<br>
  Tooltip: &quot;First Page&quot;

  <p><li><b>Previous Page</b>button - scrolls to the previous page<br>
  Tooltip: &quot;Previous Page&quot; 

  <p><li><b>Page Number</b> - text field<br>
  This text field can be used to navigate to a certain page. By entering
  the number of the page and hitting Enter the window scrolls to show
  the desired page. The content of the text field is then adjusted to
  a form &quot;&lt;page number&gt; of &lt;pages count&gt;&quot; and
  the whole content is selected.<br>The contents of this text field is
  automatically updated as the user clicks on one of the navigation
  buttons.

  <p><li><b>Next Page</b> button - scrolls to the next page<br>
  Tooltip: &quot;Next Page&quot;

  <p><li><b>Last Page</b> button - scrolls to the last page<br>
  Tooltip: &quot;Last Page&quot;

  <p><li><b>Fit to Window</b> button - sets the preview zoom scale to such
  a value that the first page or/and all the pages are fitted in window.<br>
  Tooltip: &quot;Fit to Window&quot;</P>

  <li><b>Preview Scale</b> combobox - can be used to adjust the preview scale<br>
  Items: 400%, 200%, 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, Fit to Window<br>
  If the user selects the &quot;Fit to Window&quot; item, the scale
  is set to such a value that the first page or/and all the pages are visible.

  <p><li><b>Zoom In</b> button - adjusts the preview scale by +5%.
  
  <p><li><b>Zoom Out</b> button - adjusts the preview scale by -5%.

  <p><li><b>Preview Panel</b> within scroll pane

  <p><li><b>Print</b> button - invokes the Print Dialog and closes this window

  <p><li><b>Options </b>button - invokes the Print Options dialog on top of this window

  <p><li><P><b>Close</b> button - closes this window
</ul>

<h3>Print Options Dialog</h3>

In the Print Options dialog the user can set various attributes
for printing. These are persisted between different invocations of
the dialog as well as starts of the IDE.

<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions1.png" align=bottom border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions2.png" align=bottom border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions3.png" align=bottom border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions4.png" align=bottom border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions5.png" align=bottom border=0>
<br><br><img src="images/PrintOptions6.png" align=bottom border=0>

<p><b>Figure - Print Options Dialog</b><br>

<ul>
  <p><li><b>Print Border</b> checkbox - If selected, the border will be printed

  <p><li><b>Choose Font</b> button - brings up the standard NetBeans font chooser<br>
  Tooltip: Choose Font

  <p><li><b>Choose Color</b> button - brings up the standard NetBeans color chooser<br>
  Tooltip: Choose Color

  <p><li><b>Pattern buttons</b> - a set of buttons used to construct a footer
  or header pattern. When clicked a pattern is inserted to the focused footer
  or header text field. The buttons are disabled if the focus is not in any
  of the pattern text fields.

  <p><li><b>Header and Footer Pattern</b> text fields - contain patterns
  for footer and header in left, central or right areas 

  <p><li><b>Fit to</b> and <b>Zoom to</b> radio buttons<br>
  By default (when the IDE starts for the first time), this setting
  is set to Zoom to 100%.

  <p><li><b>Fit to</b> text fields and <b>Zoom to</b> combobox
  <ul>
    <p><li>The values of these three components are linked together.
    As the user types in a number or selects a value from the combobox
    the respective values in the remaining components are recomputed to
    match that value. E.g. changing the scale from 100% to 200% will
    double the values in the fit to text fields. 

    <p><li>When the dialog is opened the values are also precomputed based
    on the current selection of the radio buttons and corresponding value.

    <p><li>As the user types in a value or select an element, corresponding
    radio button is selected.

    <p><li>The items in the scale to combobox are 150%, 125%, 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%.
  </ul>
</ul>
