<p>Operators can take streams or relations as input, and output streams, relations or entire tables. Operators can be categorized by their input and output:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Stream to relation</strong>. Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a relation as output.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation to stream.</strong> Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a stream as output with the same schema as the relation.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation to relation.</strong> Operators that take one or more relations as input and produce a relation as output.</li>
  <li><strong>Stream to stream</strong>. Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a stream as output. The input stream and the output scheme can have different schemas.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation-to-table</strong>. Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a table as output.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also think of operators as performing functions in the following manner.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Input</strong>. Receiving data from other external sources. </li>
  <li><strong>Output</strong>. Sends data out to external recipients. </li>
  <li><strong>Correlation and Filter</strong>. Correlation enables you to obtain data based on the relationship of two pieces of existing data. Filtering enables you to provide information to obtain a subset of data you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregator.</strong> Aggregates or summarizes data.</li>
  <li><strong>Stream Converter.</strong> Converts stream data to a relation.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation Converter.</strong> Converts a relation to a stream or table.</li>
  <li><strong>Relation Operator.</strong> Performs operations on a relation.</li>
</ul>
