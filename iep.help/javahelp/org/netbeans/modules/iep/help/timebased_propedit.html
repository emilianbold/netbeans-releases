<h2>Using the Time Based Aggregator Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Time Based Aggregator operator performs statistical analysis within a specified amount of time which you provide as a Size, which is period of time over which you can perform a calculation,or the time slot. Increment specifies the frequency of the calculation; that is, how often you calculate the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>For example, you want to calculate a stock price's 20 day moving average. You can supply a  Size of 20 in the Time Based Aggregator property editor, and an Increment that specifies often you want to perform that calculation; for example, once a day. </p>
<p>Statistics you can compute via SQL statements within the Property Editor of the Tuple Based Aggregator include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sum</li>
  <li>Average</li>
  <li>Minimum</li>
  <li>Maximum</li>
  <li>COUNT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a Time Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Time Based Aggregator operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Double-click the Time Based Aggregator operator  icon. The property editor opens. </li>
  <li>In the Start field, enter the time to start calculating the tasks that are to be performed by the Time Based Aggregator within the process.</li>
  <li>In the Increment field, enter the  time increment for the Time Based Aggregator to perform the analysis.</li>
  <li>In the Size field, enter the time range for the  Time Based Aggregator to perform the analysis.</li>
  <li>In the Expression box, enter the expression for the SQL Select statement to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. Add attribute names, data types. and sizes, as applicable. </li>
  <li>In the From box, define the input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>
  <li>In the Where clause box, provide additional filtering on records, for example, <tt>WHERE price &gt; 30.00 AND stockDate &lt; '2006-01-01' </tt>; </li>
  <li>In the Group by box, group a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns of the database by specifying a comma-separated list of qualified attribute names.</li>
  <li>Click OK. </li>
</ol>
