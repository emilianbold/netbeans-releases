<p> At a specific time, the Attribute Based Window operator retains any event whose attribute value falls in the range defined by the attribute value of the most recently received event relative to the current time, less the value of the attribute you provide in the Size property in the Attribute Based Window property editor.</p>
<p>The Attribute Based Window operator is a stream-to-relation converter operator..</p>
<p><strong>To create an Attribute Based Window operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag an Attribute Based Window operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Attribute Based Window operator icon. The property editor opens with the name of the Attribute Based Window operator and the output schema name populated. The Property Window displays the schema of the data that is input to the Attribute Based Window operator. </li>
  <li>Supply the Attribute that is to be tracked for a specific column.</li>
  <li>Enter a Size value which represents the difference between the most recently received record's attributes and any previous records. Only records that fall within that range will be passed through. </li>
  <li>Click Ok.</li>
