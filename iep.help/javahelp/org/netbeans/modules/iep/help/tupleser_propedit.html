<h2>Using the Tuple Serial Correlation Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Tuple Serial Correlation operator provides correlation of sequential events; that is, it uses a specification of a number of events from an existing stream to create a  stream that contains larger events. </p>
<p>For example, you have a stream of transactions of a stock, and you want to compute a new stream in which each event is composed of three consecutive events from the original stream. Using this functionality, you can build a trading model that predicts the next stock prices, using the latest two stock prices.</p>
<p><strong>To create a Tuple Serial Correlation operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Tuple Serial Correlation  operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Tuple Serial Correlation   operator icon.The property editor opens. </li>
  <li>In the Increment field, enter how often you want to obtain events via the Tuple Serial Correlation operator, based on the number of events. </li>
  <li>In the Size field, specify the number of small consecutive events that you want to add to the larger cumulative event.</li>
</ol>
