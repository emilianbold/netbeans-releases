<h2>Using the Tuple Based Aggregator Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> The Tuple Based Aggregator operator performs statistical analysis for a specified number of records (also called tuples) that you  provide as a Size, and also for an Increment that indicates how often you want the operation performed.</p>
<p> For example, provided a stream of stock transactions, the Tuple Based Aggregator operator  computes a new stream that holds the minimum, average, and maximum of the stock price of every 10 transactions, in which the Size is 10.</p>
<p>Statistics you can compute via SQL statements within the Property Editor of the Tuple Based Aggregator include:</p>
<ul><li>Sum</li>
  <li>Average</li>
  <li>Minimum</li>
  <li>Maximum</li>
  <li>COUNT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a Tuple Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Tuple Based Aggregation operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Tuple Based Aggregation operator icon. The property editor opens. </li>
  <li>In the Start field, enter  the record in which you want the operator calculations to begin.</li>
  <li>In the Increment field, enter how often you want the analysis performed.</li>
  <li>In the Expression box enter the expression for the SQL Select statement which is used to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. You can add, delete, or move Attributes.</li>
  <li>In the From box, define the input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>
  <li>In the Where clause box, provide additional filtering on records, for example, <tt>WHERE price &gt; 30.00 AND stockDate &lt; '2006-01-01' </tt>; </li>
  <li>In the Group by box, group a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns of the database by specifying a comma separated list of qualified attribute names.</li>
  <li>Click Ok.</li>
</ol>
