<h2>About the Operator Environment </h2>

<p>IEP Operators are used in conjunction with the following data formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Table.</strong> A finite collection of events that belong to the same schema. </li>
  <li><strong>Streams.</strong> A collection of events that belong to the same schema, and which have timestamps. The schema is also called the stream's schema. </li>
  <li><strong>Relations.</strong> A collection of tables that have the same schema, and which are indexed by time. The schema for a relation is also called the relation's schema.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operators and Schemas</strong></p>
<p>You typically provide a schema definition in the property editor for the  Stream Input operator, by providing an output schema name and one or more attribute name, data type and size information.</p>
<p>Many operators that follow the Stream Input Stream operator do not alter your schema definition, as these operators do not modify data or its format as it moves through the Intelligent Event Processing Module.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this rule include the following modifier operators:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Relation Map</li>
  <li>Relation Aggregator</li>
  <li>Tuple Based Aggregator</li>
  <li>Time Based Aggregator</li>
  <li>Tuple Serial Correlation</li>
  <li>Stream Project and Filter</li>
</ul>
<p>Operators that follow any of these modifiers inherit their new output schema.</p>
<p>Windows, also known as sliding windows, enable you to conceive of a meaningful boundary on the event stream so you can query it effectively.</p>
