# Notice:
# a, b and d are accessed from within the fragment, so they are passed in.
# c is reassigned in the fragment without reading the previous value, so
#   doesn't need to be passed in.
# f and h are assigned locally inside the extracted fragment, but are not read
#   outside of it, so does not need to be passed back out
# g is assigned inside the fragment, and read later outside, so it is returned
#   from the new method but not passed in
# h is assigned inside the fragment, and is read later, but it is assigned
#   before this read access so the value doesn't need to be passed back
# i is also assigned inside the fragment, and -may- be read after the fragment,
#   so it too is passed back out
