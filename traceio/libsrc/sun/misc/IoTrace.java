/**
 * Utility class used to identify trace points for I/O calls.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, a diagnostic tool must redefine this class with a version
 * that contains calls to the the diagnostic tool. This implementation will then
 * receive callbacks when file and socket operations are performed. The reason
 * for requiring a redefine of the class is to avoid any overhead caused by the
 * instrumentation.
 * <p>
 * The xxBegin() methods return a "context". This can be any Object. This
 * context will be passed to the corresponding xxEnd() method. This way, an
 * implementation can correlate the beginning of an operation with the end.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for a xxEnd() method to be called with a null handle. This
 * happens if tracing was started between the call to xxBegin() and xxEnd(), in
 * which case xxBegin() would not have been called. It is the implementation's
 * responsibility to not throw an exception in this case.
 * <p>
 * Only blocking I/O operations are identified with this facility.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning</b>
 * <p>
 * These methods are called from sensitive points in the I/O subsystem. Great
 * care must be taken to not interfere with ongoing operations or cause
 * deadlocks. In particular:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementations must not throw exceptions since this will cause
 * disruptions to the I/O operations.
 * <li>Implementations must not do I/O operations since this will lead to an
 * endless loop.
 * <li>Since the hooks may be called while holding low-level locks in the I/O
 * subsystem, implementations must be careful with synchronization or
 * interaction with other threads to avoid deadlocks in the VM.
 * </ul>
