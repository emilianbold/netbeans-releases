/**
 * Used as a callback to acquire user's credentials and ask caller about 
 * different questions during an inter-repository commands, e.g. fetch, push, clone.
 * If an API client runs a git command that accesses a remote repository and the repository
 * requires authentication then this is the class it should use to pass the credentials.
 * <h5>How to use this class</h5>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Get an instance of {@link GitClient} you want to run the fetch command with, see {@link GitRepository}</li>
 * <li>Extend this class and implement all abstract methods</li>
 * <li>Pass the instance of the class to the git client, see {@link GitClient#setCallback(org.netbeans.libs.git.remote.GitClientCallback) }</li>
 * <li>Run a remote command, see e.g. {@link GitClient#fetch(java.lang.String, org.netbeans.libs.git.remote.progress.ProgressMonitor) }</li>
 * <li>While the fetch command is running, methods <code>getUsername</code> and <code>getPassword</code> will be called from within the client
 * so make sure they return the correct credentials</li>
 * </ol>
 * Let's assume we want to run a fetch command on a remote repository at http://myrepositoryhost/path 
 * that requires credentials username/password:
 * <pre>
 * GitClient client = {@link GitRepository#getInstance(java.io.File) GitRepository.getInstance(myLocalReposiry)}.{@link GitRepository#createClient() createClient()};
 * GitClientCallback myCallback = {@link GitClientCallback#GitClientCallback() new GitClientCallback ()} {
 *     public String askQuestion (String uri, String prompt) { return null; }
 *     
 *     public String getUsername (String uri, String prompt) {
 *         return "username";
 *     }
 *     
 *     public char[] getPassword (String uri, String prompt) {
 *         return "password".toCharArray();
 *     }
 *         
 *     public char[] getPassphrase (String uri, String prompt) { return null; }
 * 
 *     public String getIdentityFile (String uri, String prompt);
 *     public Boolean askYesNoQuestion (String uri, String prompt);
 * };
 * client.{@link GitClient#setCallback(org.netbeans.libs.git.remote.GitClientCallback) setCallback(myCallback)};
 * List<String> refspecs = Arrays.asList("refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*");
 * client.fetch("http://myrepositoryhost/path", refspecs, pm);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Also note that returning <code>null</code> from the implemented methods means that you want to cancel the authentication attempt.</p>
