/**
 * A representation of a local Git repository, used to create git clients bound to the repository.
 * <p>Instances are bound to a local folder with actual Git repository. If the repository does not exist yet, you 
 * still have to provide a local file which indicates where the repository would be created when 
 * {@link GitClient#init(org.netbeans.libs.git.remote.progress.ProgressMonitor) } was called.</p>
 * <p>To get an instance of <code>GitClient</code> to run git commands with, use {@link #createClient() } method. It <strong>always</strong> returns
 * a new instance of the <code>GitClient</code>, it is not shared among the callers.<p>
 * <p>When done with the client - you finish calling all desired commands and do not
 * plan to use the client's instance any more - {@link GitClient#release() } must be called.
 * When all created clients are released this way, repository metadata are flushed,
 * all open metadata files are closed and thus do not block any external tools 
 * (such as a commandline client).</p>
 * <p>Internally the class keeps a map of its instances that are cached under
 * a weak reference to the instance of the local file passed in the {@link #getInstance(java.io.File) } method.
 * Along with the instance it caches also all repository metadata (branches, index, references etc.) 
 * needed to construct the client and operate with the actual Git repository.<br/>
 * Every call to the <code>getInstance</code> method with the same instance of the file 
 * will always return the same instance of <code>GitRepository</code>. <strong>It is up to a caller's
 * responsibility</strong> to hold a strong reference to the file so a created client always works with 
 * the same instance of the git repository.</p>
