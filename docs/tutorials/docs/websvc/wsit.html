        <h1>Advanced Web Service Interoperability</h1>

        <p>Advanced Web Service Interoperability (WSIT), also referred to as Web Service 
            "Quality of Service", encompasses components that enable interoperability between
            Java web services and .Net web services.
        This document demonstrates some of the support in the IDE for configuring a web service
        and client that use WSIT. For more information on using WSIT, see
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19159-01/820-1072/ahibn/index.html">Chapter 3 WSIT Example Using a Web Container and NetBeans IDE</a>

            <!--Exercise 1: -->
        <a name="Exercise_0"></a>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Components relating to advanced web services interoperability
        fall into four main categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bootstrapping and configuration.</b> The process that is executed to 
                create a Web service client that can access and consume a Web service.</li>
            <li><b>Message security.</b> The following security configuration options are supported:
                <ul>
                    <li>Targets to sign and encrypt options</li>
                    <li>Client/service Web services security</li>
                    <li>Client/service trust options</li>
                    <li>Advanced configuration options</li>
                    <li>Keystore configuration options</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Message optimization.</b> Ensures that Web services
                messages are transmitted over the Internet in the most efficient
                manner. Message optimization is achieved in Web services communication
                by encoding messages prior to transmission and then de-encoding
                them when they reach there final destination.</li>
            <li><b>Reliable messaging.</b> Measured by a system's
                ability to deliver messages from point A to point B without error.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"Quality of service" is configured in the Web Service Attributes Editor,
            which can be accessed from the node representing
            the web service or client in the Projects window. In this document 
            you are introduced to two samples that are distributed with the IDE: 
            an unsecured web service sample and a secured web service sample.
            This document will show some of the differences between the samples
            and also how to use the IDE to configure security for your own web services and clients.</p>

        <p>For a full and complete guide to topics relating to 'Quality of Service',
            see <a target="_blank" href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/reference/tutorials/wsit/doc/index.html">The WSIT Tutorial</a>.

            <!-- ===================================================================================== -->
        <a name="Exercise_1"></a><h2>Getting to Know the Calculator Sample</h2>
        <p>The goal of this exercise is to
            get to know the Calculator sample that is bundled
            with the IDE. In contrast to the next sample, this
            sample is not secured, as you will see when you examine the web service.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Exercise_1_1"></a>Exploring the Sample</h3>
            <p>In this exercise you will use the New Project wizard to create the sample, 
                examine the sample in the IDE and deploy the application.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N on Linux and Windows, &#8984;-Shift-N on MacOS)
                    to open the New Project wizard.</li>
                    <li>Expand the Samples category and select the Web Services
                    node and then select the Calculator sample. Click Next.<br>
                <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-newproject.png" alt="New Project wizard showing calculator sample" title="New Project wizard showing calculator sample"  class="margin-around b-all"></li>
                <li>Confirm that a Java EE-compliant server is selected in the Server drop-down list. 
                    Click Finish.
                    <p>When you click Finish the wizard creates two projects: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CalculatorApp</strong> provides a web service named CalculatorWS that exposes an operation named 'add'.</li>
                        <li><strong>CalculatorClientApp</strong> provides a client named CalculatorWSService that invokes the web service's 'add' operation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="alert">The CalculatorClientApp service might be badged with an error icon
                    because the IDE cannot find the WSDL for the CalculatorWS service. 
                    The error will be resolved after you deploy CalculatorApp and clean and build the CalculatorClientApp.</p>
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-projects.png" alt="Projects window displaying the web service and the client" class="margin-around b-all" title="Projects window displaying the web service and the client"></li>
                <li>Double-click the CalculatorWS web service to open the file in the editor and click the
                    Design tab at the top of the editor to view the web service in the visual designer.<br>
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-design.png" alt="CalculatorWS service in Design GUI (Visual Designer) tab" class="margin-around b-all" title="CalculatorWS service in Design GUI (Visual Designer) tab">
                    <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> In the Quality of Service section in the design tab of the service you can see that <i>no</i> options are enabled.
                        As a result, the Quality of Service components have not been applied to this particular web service.
                        You will look at a web service where a Quality of Service component <em>is</em> enabled when you create the secure web service.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="Exercise_1_2"></a>Deploying and Testing the Calculator Sample</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Right-click the CalculatorApp project and choose Run.
                    <p>The server starts and the web service is deployed to the server.
                        You will see a page open in your default browser that provides some details of the service.</p>
                        <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-browser1.png" alt="CalculatorWS information window in browser"  class="margin-around b-all" title="CalculatorWS information window in browser"></li>
                <li>Click on the WSDL link in the page in the browser to see the WSDL file that
                    defines the web service.
                    <br><img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-browser2.png" alt="Calculator WS WSDL in browser" class="margin-around b-all" title="Calculator WS WSDL in browser">
                <p class="notes"><b>Note.</b> If the WSDL does not display, check the URL in the browser's location bar. 
                        It should point to <tt>http://localhost:<em>your_port_number</em>/CalculatorApp/CalculatorWSService?WSDL</tt>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>In the Projects window of the IDE, right-click CalculatorWS under the Web Services node and choose Test Web Service in the popup menu.<br>
                    <p>When you test the web service a page for testing the service opens in your browser.</p>
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-browser3.png" alt="Calculator WS Tester in browser" class="margin-around b-all" title="Calculator WS Tester in browser"> 
                    <p>The IDE can provide a client for testing your web service and
                    open the test application in your browser.
                    In the test application you can enter values for each of the fields defined in the web service. 
                    The test application has a button that is labeled after the name of the operation in the service.
                    When you click the button you will see the result of invoking the operation.</p>
                    </li>
                <li>Examine the CalculatorClientApp project in the Projects window for any error badges.
                    <p>If there are error icons for <tt>ClientServlet.java</tt>, right-click the project node and
                    choose Clean and Build in the popup menu. 
                    The errors appeared because the CalculatorWS service was not deployed. 
                    Now that it is deployed, the IDE can parse the WSDL and the ClientServlet compiles.</p></li>
                <li>Right-click the CalculatorClientApp project node and choose Run.
                    <p>When you run the application an interface for the service opens in your browser.</p>
                    <img src="../../../images_www/articles/74/websvc/wsit/wsit-browser4.png" alt="Calculator Service client in browser" class="margin-around b-all" title="Calculator Service client in browser"></li>
                <li>Enter values in the two fields and click Get Result.
                    <p>When you click Get Result the result of the operation is retrieved from the 
                        web service and displayed in the client.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>The web service is functioning correctly and the client retrieves results,
                but this project does not make use of the Quality of Service components. 
                In the next section, you will see how you can configure Quality of Service components.</p>

                        provide your own certificates and user settings, however,
                        in a development environment you may find these defaults

                <li>Right-click the web service project node and choose Run to deploye the web service.</li>
                <li>Right-click the web service client project node and choose Run. 
                    <p>When you run the client the application is deployed and 
                        and the interface for the service opens in the browser.</p>

                    <p>When you click Get Result the page will display a message that the
                        client was authenticated and will display the result of the operation.</p>

            <p class="notes">If you get an error message that authentication failed due to an invalid user/password pair, 
                there is either a problem with the default user created by the IDE or there are mismatched credentials 
                set on the client. 
                In this case, you need to create the user/password pair manually.
