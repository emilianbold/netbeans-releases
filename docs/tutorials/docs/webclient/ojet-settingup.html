        <h1>Setting Up an Oracle JET Application</h1>

        <p>
            This document provides a step-by-step set of instructions guiding
            you through the process of setting up an application based on
            <a href="http://oraclejet.org">Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)</a>. 
            JET empowers web and mobile developers
            by providing a modular toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3,
            and HTML5 design and development principles.</p>

        <!-- ++++++++++++++++ Setting Up ++++++++++++++++ -->
        <h2 id="seealso">Setting Up</h2>

        <p>In this exercise you learn how to set up an Oracle JET application
             via the <tt>ojet-cli</tt> tool.</p>
        <p class='notes'><b>Note:</b> If you have been using the Yeoman-based generator,
            that is, <tt>generator-oraclejet</tt>, you must install it
            before continuing with the steps below, via <tt>npm -g uninstall generator-oraclejet</tt>.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the command prompt in a terminal window, type the following:</p>
                <pre>node -v</pre>
                <p>If the terminal window shows that Node is not installed or at a 
                    lower version than 5, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">go to the Node site</a> and 
                    install the Long Term Support (LTS) release of Node. Currently, at the time of writing,
                    the LTS release is v6.11.2, and is listed as being "recommended
                    for most users".</p>  
                <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> Do not use the Latest release of Node, i.e., v8.x.  
                    The Node Package Manager (NPM) version 5 that comes with Node v8.x 
                    has bugs that cause nested dev-dependencies 
                    to not be installed properly. This is listed in our <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalSupport-releaseNotes.html">Release Notes for JET 3.2.0</a> and 
                    we are watching the npm bugs to see when they are going to fix them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After completing the above step, install the Oracle JET Command Line (<tt><a href="https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli">ojet-cli</a></tt>) tool as follows:</p> 
                <p><pre>npm -g install ojet-cli</pre></p>
                <p class="notes"><b>Note:</b> You may need to be in admin mode, such as via <tt>sudo -s</tt> on
                 Mac OS X, to be able to call the above command.</p>
                <p class="tips">Under the covers, the <tt>ojet-cli</tt> tool installs and uses
                 popular JavaScript tools, such as Yeoman and Grunt, as can 
                 <a href="https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli/blob/master/package.json">be seen here</a>. Where
                 previously, you'd have to use commands such as <tt>yo</tt> and <tt>grunt</tt>, these
                 are now hidden within the <tt>ojet-cli</tt> tool and do not need to be installed
                 separately anymore.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The <tt>-g</tt> argument in the previous step should have installed
                the <tt>ojet</tt> command globally, so that you should be able
                to run <tt>ojet</tt> anywhere, i.e., not in any specific folder
                or location since the <tt>ojet</tt> command should now be
                globally available. To try it out, run the following:
                <pre>ojet help</pre>
                <p>The terminal window should now show all the commands available
                   to be used with <tt>ojet</tt>. If not, you can manually configure the
                   PATH of your system to include <tt>ojet-cli</tt>.
                </p>    
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you have successfully run <tt>ojet help</tt>, use <tt>ojet</tt> to create a new Oracle JET application, as follows:</p> 
                <p><pre>ojet create MyApp --template=navdrawer</pre></p>
                <p class="tips">'navdrawer', in the command line above, is one of the starter templates made available by Oracle JET,
                 as outlined below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-Drawer.html">Nav Drawer Starter</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-NavBar.html">Nav Bar Starter</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-Basic.html">Basic Starter</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>After the process completes, you should have an application structured as follows:</p>
                <p><img src="../../../images_www/articles/82/web/oraclejet-gettingstarted/navdrawer.png"/></p>
                <p class="tips">Open the application into an editor or IDE of your
                     choice, such as NetBeans IDE, which displays the
                     application as shown in the screenshot above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the application is created, use the terminal window to navigate into the root folder,
                    i.e., the top folder, which is named <tt>MyApp</tt>, 
                    and build and serve the application, as follows:</p> 
                <p><pre>ojet serve</pre></p>
                <p>After the build completes, the browser opens and displays the application:</p>
                <p><img style="border:1px solid black" src="../../../images_www/articles/82/web/oraclejet-gettingstarted/newhtml5project-9.png"/></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations, you have successfully set up an Oracle JET application. Repeat
         the steps above whenever you need to set up a new Oracle JET
         application.</p>
