<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Large C/C++ projects consist of thousands of files. For example, the Linux kernel
    has about 20,000 files. If you are developing such a project and want
    to rebuild it after a small change - say, a one line fix - 
    there are two options.

<ul>
<li>
    Full rebuild (Clean and Build action). It is slower,
    but guarantees a consistent build result.
</li>
<li>
    Incremental rebuild (Build action). It is faster,
    but will it correctly rebuild everything that should be rebuilt?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The major problem with incremental rebuild is the presence of <tt>#include</tt>
    directives, which include one file's content into another file. The included file
    is known as a file dependency. Modification
    of the included file should be treated as modification of all files that
    include it. Indirect includes (A includes B, B includes C =&gt; A includes C)
    make the problem even harder.
</p>

<p>
    NetBeans IDE supports automatic checking of file dependencies and
    does its best to make incremental rebuild work correctly. If you change
    a header file that is included into some of your source files and then
    click Build, the IDE will rebuild only those
    parts of the project that really depend on the changed header.
    This feature saves time and guarantees consistent build results.
</p>

<h3>Enabling Dependency Checking for a Project</h3>

<p>
    Dependency checking can be controlled for each particular project.
    You may want to ensure that it's enabled.
</p>
      <p><b>To enable dependency checking for a project:</b></p>

      <ol>
         <li>Right-click the project in the Projects window and choose Properties.</li>
         <li>
            In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Build node in the Categories list.
         </li>
         <li>In the build properties, select the checkbox for Enable Make Dependency Checking.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>

<br>
    <h3>Enabling Dependency Checking by Default for New Projects</h3>
<p>You can set a default state for dependency checking so that new projects you create are automatically
enabled for make dependency checking.</p>
 <p><b>To enable dependency checking for all new projects created in the IDE:</b></p>

 <ol>
         <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options in the IDE main menu.</li>
         <li>
            Click the C/C++ button in the top pane.
         </li>
         <li>Click the Project Options tab.</li>
         <li>Select the checkbox for Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles</li>

        
      </ol>
      <br>

<h3 class="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
    Automatic dependency checking works for C/C++ projects that were created in the IDE
    (managed projects). The IDE builds dependency checking logic into the generated <tt>Makefile</tt>.
    For projects created with existing sources you have to rely on dependency
    checking logic (if any) in the existing <tt>Makefile</tt>.
</li>
<li>
    Dependency checking requires support from your tool collection 
    (<tt>make</tt> and compilers). It has been tested with the Oracle Solaris Studio tool collection 
    and GNU tool collections including Cygwin and MinGW.
</li>
<li>
    Dependency checking works when Oracle Solaris Studio compilers are used together with
    Oracle Solaris <tt>make</tt>  and when GNU compilers are used with GNU <tt>gmake</tt>. 
    Mixing Oracle Solaris <tt>make</tt> with GNU compilers and vice versa is not supported.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The rest of the article is for those advanced users who
    want to know what happens under the IDE's hood.
</p>


<h2><a name="build"></a>Build Process (make and makefiles)</h2>
<p>
    The build process of every C/C++ project in NetBeans is described
    in a <tt>Makefile</tt>, a file of special format understood by the
    <tt>make</tt> utility. When you build or clean your project from the GUI,
    the IDE invokes <tt>make</tt>, which executes the Makefile. This approach
    allows you to easily build your project outside of the IDE using <tt>make</tt>:
    just go to your project directory and type <tt>make help</tt> to get instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Makefiles used by NetBeans IDE for a C/C++ project are shown
    below.
</p>

<img src="../../../images_www/articles/73/cnd/depchecking/makefiles.png" alt="Makefiles used by NetBeans for C/C++ projects" class="margin-around">

<p>
    The master <tt>Makefile</tt> is generated once and you can edit it manually.
    Makefiles in <tt>nbproject</tt> directory are not meant for manual
    editing; they are updated automatically by the IDE.  The file 
    <tt>Makefile-<i>CONF</i>.mk</tt> in the illustration represents multiple files for all your 
     project configurations, 
    such as <tt>Makefile-Release.mk</tt>, <tt>Makefile-Debug.mk</tt>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
    For a managed project, the IDE generates all the makefiles itself
    and inserts proper instructions for dependency checking. For 
    a project created from existing sources, dependency checking will
    work only if the existing <tt>Makefile</tt> contains such instructions,
    because the NetBeans IDE doesn't change the existing <tt>Makefile</tt>.
</p>


<h2><a name="basics"></a>Dependency Generation Basics</h2>

<p>
    If you want <tt>make</tt> to check included file dependencies during build
    then you have to insert dependency information into the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
    Unfortunately there is no portable way to do this for all <tt>make</tt> utilities
    and compilers. First, you should detect which <tt>make</tt> is running,
    and then generate corresponding dependency checking instructions.
</p>

<p>
    The Oracle Solaris <tt>make</tt> has a very simple solution. A special <tt>.KEEP_STATE:</tt>
    rule in the <tt>Makefile</tt> instructs <tt>make</tt> to query the compiler about included
    file dependencies and store them in a temporary file. Next time
    the project is rebuilt, <tt>make</tt> loads that temporary file,
    analyzes dependencies stored there, and determines which headers changed
    and which object files should be recompiled.
</p>

<p>
    For GNU <tt>make</tt> (called <tt>gmake</tt>) the solution is more complex. You have to explicitly
    ask the compiler to generate dependency information and then explicitly
    include it into the <tt>Makefile</tt>. The idea is to pass special flags
    to the compiler, so that the compiler will generate dependency information
    for each compiled source file. Next time the project is rebuilt, dependency
    information is collected and included into the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
</p>


<h2><a name="implementation"></a>Implementation</h2>

<p>
    The following code is added to <tt>nbproject/Makefile-impl.mk</tt>.
    It detects which <tt>make</tt> is running and puts corresponding
    dependency checking code into the file <tt>.dep.inc</tt>. GNU <tt>make</tt> is detected
    by the presence of <tt>MAKE_VERSION</tt> variable. If <tt>MAKE_VERSION</tt>
    is not set, then the Solaris <tt>make</tt>-specific instructions are generated.
</p>

<pre class="examplecode"># dependency checking support
.depcheck-impl:
	@echo "# This code depends on make tool being used" &gt;.dep.inc
	@if [ -n "${MAKE_VERSION}" ]; then \
	    echo "DEPFILES=\$$(wildcard \$$(addsuffix .d, \$${OBJECTFILES}))" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	    echo "ifneq (\$${DEPFILES},)" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	    echo "include \$${DEPFILES}" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	    echo "endif" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	else \
	    echo ".KEEP_STATE:" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	    echo ".KEEP_STATE_FILE:.make.state.\$${CONF}" &gt;&gt;.dep.inc; \
	fi</pre>

<p>
    The following code is added to <tt>nbproject/Makefile-${CONF}.mk</tt>.
    It instructs <tt>make</tt> to read previously generated <tt>.dep.inc</tt>
    and execute instructions from it.
</p>

<pre class="examplecode"># Enable dependency checking
.dep.inc: .depcheck-impl

include .dep.inc</pre>

<p>
    The rule <tt>.dep.inc: .depcheck-impl</tt> is added to prevent build
    failure when <tt>.dep.inc</tt> does not exist. There is only one case
    when it happens: when you compile single file from the Projects window.
    In this case <tt>make</tt> executes file <tt>nbproject/Makefile-${CONF}.mk</tt>
    directly.
