This directory contains project to build NetBeans IDE packages for Ubuntu.

Prerequisities:
Standard packages for building packages must be installed (debhelper, fakeroot).

Packages are arch independent so it is possible to generate just one set of packages
for both i386 and amd64 arch.

make.sh invokes dpkg-buildpackage to build IDE and Platform packages.

clean.sh cleans temporary files created by building process in current directory and in debian
directory.

Source for building process (for building binary packages) are tar.gz files of IDE and Platform
builds in current directory. Javadoc and documentation. It is set in file debian/rules.
nb55-jumbodocpack.zip
netbeans-5_5_1-javadoc.tar.gz
netbeans-5_5_1-platform.tar.gz
netbeans-5_5_1.tar.gz

Packages are built in parent directory. (This is default behavior of dpkg-buildpackage and I did not find
any way how to change it.
