FIX_SA00007_SA00008=The <{0}> activity must only be used from within a faultHandler, another compensationHandler, or a terminationHandler.
FIX_SA00051=InputVariable attribute must not be used on an Invoke activity that contains <toPart> elements.
FIX_SA00052=OutputVariable attribute must not be used on an Invoke activity that contains <fromPart> elements.
FIX_SA00053=The part attribute of the <fromPart> element must reference a valid message part in the WSDL message for the operation.
FIX_SA00054=The part attribute of the <toPart> element must reference a valid message part in the WSDL message for the operation.
FIX_SA00055=If <fromPart> elements are used on a <receive> activity the variable attribute must not be used on the same activity.
FIX_SA00059=If <toPart> elements are used on a <reply> activity the variable attribute must not be used on the same activity.

# {0} - attribute name
FIX_SA00035_SA00036=In the from-spec of the partnerLink variant of <assign> \
the value "{0}" for attribute endpointReference is only permitted when the \
partnerLink specifies the attribute {0}.

# {0} - activity name
FIX_SA00092=The name "{0}" of a named activity must be unique among \
all named activities present within the same immediately enclosing scope.

# {0} - link name
FIX_SA00064=The link name "{0}" must be unique amongst all link names \
defined within the same immediately enclosing flow.

# {0} - link name
FIX_SA00065=An activity may declare itself to be the source \
of one or more links by including one or more <source> elements. \
Each <source> element associated with a given activity must use \
a distinct link name. Found several sources with the same link name "{0}". 

# {0} - link name
FIX_SA00068_SA00069=An activity may declare itself to be the target \
of one or more links by including one or more <target> elements. \
Each <target> element associated with a given activity must use \
a distinct link name. Found several targets with the same link name "{0}". 

# {0} - variable name
FIX_SA00023=The variable name "{0}" must be unique amongst the names \
of all variables defined within the same immediately enclosing scope.

# {0} - variable name
FIX_SA00076_SA00077_SA00078=For <forEach> the enclosed scope must not declare a \
variable with the same name "{0}" as specified in the counterName attribute of <forEach>.

FIX_SA00091=A scope with the isolated="yes" attribute is called an \
isolated scope. Isolated scopes must not contain other isolated scopes.

FIX_SA00090=If the variable attribute is used in the <onEvent> element, either the messageType \
or the element attribute must be provided in the <onEvent> element.

FIX_SA00083_SA00088=An event handler must contain at least one <onEvent> or <onAlarm> element.

FIX_SA00081=For the <catch> construct; to have a defined type \
associated with the fault variable, the faultVariable attribute must only be \
used if either the faultMessageType or faultElement attributes but not both, accompany it. \
The faultMessageType and faultElement attributes must not be \
used unless accompanied by faultVariable attribute.

FIX_SA00080=There must be at least one <catch> or <catchAll> \
element within a <faultHandlers> element.

FIX_SA00003=If the value of exitOnStandardFault of a <scope> or \
<process> is set to "yes", then a fault handler that explicitly targets the \
WS-BPEL standard faults must not be used in that scope.

FIX_SA00005=If the portType attribute is included for readability, \
in a <receive>, <reply>, <invoke>, <onEvent> or <onMessage> element, the value \
of the portType attribute must match the portType value implied by the combination \
of the specified partnerLink and the role implicitly specified by the activity. \
It means that Invoke requires partnerRole, another - myRole.

FIX_SA00012=If no namespace is specified then the imported \
definitions must not contain a targetNamespace specification.

FIX_SA00011=If a namespace attribute is specified on an <import> \
then the imported definitions must be in that namespace.

FIX_SA00013=The value of the importType attribute of element <import> \
must be set to http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema when importing XML Schema 1.0 \
documents, and to http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ when importing WSDL 1.1 documents.

FIX_SA00015=To be instantiated, an executable business \
process must contain at least one <receive> or <pick> activity annotated with a \
createInstance="yes" attribute.

FIX_SA00024=Variable names are NCNames (as defined in XML Schema \
specification) but in addition they must not contain the "." character.

FIX_SA00062=If <pick> element has a createInstance="yes" attribute, \
the events in the <pick> must all be <onMessage> events.

FIX_SA00066=Every link declared within a <flow> activity must have \
exactly one activity within the <flow> as its source and exactly one activity \
within the <flow> as its target.

FIX_SA00067=Two different links must not share the same source and target activities; \
that is, at most one link may be used to connect two activities.

FIX_SA00079=The root scope inside a Fault handler, \
Termination handler or Compensation handler must not have a compensation handler.

FIX_SA00087=For <onEvent>, the type of the variable (as specified by the \
messageType attribute) MUST be the same as the type of the input message defined by \
operation referenced by the operation attribute. Optionally the messageType attribute \
may be omitted and instead the element attribute substituted if the message to be \
received has a single part and that part is defined with an element type. That \
element type MUST be an exact match of the element type referenced by the element attribute.

FIX_SA00070=A link must not cross the boundary of \
a repeatable construct or the <compensationHandler> element. This means, a \
link used within a repeatable construct (<while>, <repeatUntil>, <forEach>, \
<eventHandlers>) or a <compensationHandler> must be declared in a <flow> \
that is itself nested inside the repeatable construct or <compensationHandler>.

FIX_SA00071=A link that crosses a <faultHandlers> or \
<terminationHandler> element boundary must be outbound only, that is, it must \
have its source activity within the <faultHandlers> or <terminationHandler>, \
and its target activity outside of the scope associated with the handler.

FIX_SA00045=Properties used in a <correlationSet> must be \
defined using XML Schema simple types. This restriction must be statically enforced.

FIX_SA00046=The pattern attribute used in <correlation> within \
<invoke> is required for request-response operations, and disallowed when a \
one-way operation is invoked.

FIX_SA00050=The WSDL message parts not explicitly \
initialized by <toPart> elements would result in un-initialized parts in the \
target anonymous WSDL variable used by the <invoke> or <reply> activity.

FIX_SA00063=If <fromPart> elements are used \
on an OnMessage activity the variable attribute must not be used on the \
same activity. 

FIX_SA00048_1=When the optional inputVariable and outputVariable \
attributes are being used in an <invoke> activity, the variables referenced by \
inputVariable and outputVariable must be messageType variables whose QName \
matches the QName of the input and output message type used in the operation, \
respectively.

FIX_SA00048_2=Only if the WSDL operation used in an <invoke> activity \
uses a message containing exactly one part which itself is defined using an \
element, then a variable of the same element type as used to define the part \
may be referenced by the inputVariable and outputVariable attributes respectively.

FIX_SA00056=A "start activity" is a <receive> or <pick> \
activity that is annotated with a createInstance="yes" attribute. Activities \
other than the following: start activities, <scope>, <flow> and <sequence> \
MUST NOT be performed prior to or simultaneously with start activities.

FIX_SA00057=If a process has multiple start \
activities (<receive> or <pick> activity that is annotated with a \
createInstance="yes" attribute) \
with correlation sets then all such activities must share at least \
one common correlationSet and all common correlationSets defined on all the \
activities must have the value of the initiate attribute be set to "join".

# {0} - property
# {1} - correlation set
FIX_SA00021=Property "{0}" does not have a propertyAlias defined for the message where the correlation set "{1}" is being used.
 
FIX_SA00022=A WS-BPEL process definition is not \
accepted for processing if it defines two or more propertyAliases for the \
same property name and WS-BPEL variable type.

FIX_SA00044=The name of a <correlationSet> must be unique \
amongst the names of all <correlationSet> defined within the same immediately enclosing scope.

FIX_SA00018=The name of a partnerLink must be unique amongst \
the names of all partnerLinks defined within the same immediately enclosing scope.

FIX_SA00025=The messageType, type or element attributes are used to \
specify the type of a variable. Exactly one of these attributes must be used. 

FIX_SA00084_SA00086_SA00089=For <onEvent>, variables referenced by the variable \
attribute of <fromPart> elements or the variable attribute of an <onEvent> element \
are implicitly declared in the associated scope of the event handler. \
Variables of the same names must not be explicitly declared in the associated scope.

FIX_SA00004=Only language referenced by "{0}" is supported by WS-BPEL definition.
FIX_SA00009=A WS-BPEL process definition has a mandatory extension with namespace "{0}" that is not supported.
FIX_SA00014=The process has duplicate imports.

# {0} - component
# {1} - first file
# {1} - second file
FIX_SA00014_Identical=Documents imported in the process contain identical definition of the component "{0}".
FIX_SA00014_Identical_File=Documents imported in the process contain identical definition of the component "{0}":\n{1}\n{2}
FIX_SA00014_Different=Documents imported in the process contain conflicting definition of the component "{0}".
FIX_SA00014_Different_File=Documents imported in the process contain conflicting definition of the component "{0}":\n{1}\n{2}

FIX_SA00047=For <invoke>, one-way invocation requires \
only the inputVariable (or its equivalent <toPart>\'s) since a response is not \
expected as part of the operation. If a WSDL message definition does not contain \
any parts, then the <fromParts> or <toParts> construct must be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_1=If a WSDL message definition does not contain \
any parts, then the associated attributes variable, inputVariable or outputVariable \
may be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_2=For <invoke>, request-response invocation \
requires both an inputVariable (or its equivalent <toPart> elements) and an \
outputVariable (or its equivalent <fromPart> elements).

FIX_SA00047_3=If a WSDL message definition \
does not contain any parts, then the associated attributes variable, \
inputVariable or outputVariable, or the associated <fromParts> or <toParts> \
elements must be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_4=For <receive> variable attribute (or its equivalent \
<fromPart> elements) must be specified. If a WSDL message definition does not contain \
any parts, then the <fromParts> construct must be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_5=If a WSDL message definition does not contain any parts, \
then the associated variable attribute may be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_6=For <reply> variable attribute (or its equivalent \
<toPart> elements) must be specified. If a WSDL message definition does not contain \
any parts, then the <toParts> construct must be omitted.

FIX_SA00047_7=If a WSDL message definition does not contain \
any parts, then the associated variable attribute may be omitted.

FIX_SA00061=The reply with "messageExchange" attribute must have multiple IMA-<reply> pair \
with the same partnerLink and operation.
