        <h2>New JSF Managed Bean Wizard: Name and Location</h2>

        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>JSF managed beans are JavaBean components that are managed by a JSF implementation.
            A JSF managed bean describes how a bean is created and managed.</p>

        <p>The New JSF Managed Bean wizard creates a new JSF managed bean. You open the New
            JSF Managed Bean wizard by right-clicking a web application, choosing New &gt;
            Other and selecting JSF Managed Bean from the JavaServer Faces category.</p>

        <p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following properties:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class Name:</strong> Specifies the JSF managed bean class name.</li>

            <li><strong>Project:</strong> Specifies the project in which the JSF managed bean
                will be located.</li>

            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Specifies a folder to house the JSF managed bean.</li>

            <li><strong>Package:</strong> Specifies a package within the location to house the
                JSF managed bean.</li>

            <li><strong>Created File:</strong> Specifies the file of the new JSF managed bean.</li>

            <li><strong>Configuration File.</strong> Specifies the Faces configuration file
                (<code>faces-config.xml</code>).

                <p class="note">If you are using JSF 2.0, you do not need a configuration file.
                    The managed bean is registered with the application using annotations. If
                    you want to register the managed bean in a configuration file and your
                    application does not have one, select the 'Add data to a configuration
                    file' option and the wizard will create one for you.)</p>
                
                <p class="note">If you are using JSF 1.2 and your application not have a
                    configuration file, you cannot proceed with the wizard. To create a new
                    configuration file, use the JSF Faces Configuration wizard. (Choose File
                    &gt; New File. Select the JavaServer Faces category and JSF Faces Configuration
                    file type.)</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Sets the scope of the JSF managed bean. Use the drop-down
                list to set the scope of the managed bean to one of the following:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>request:</strong> Request scope contains data specific to an individual
                        server request, and is discarded when the <code>service</code> method returns.
                        This is the most common scope usage in web applications, and is the default setting
                        for the IDE.</li>

                    <li><strong>session:</strong> Session scope contains data specific to a user session.</li>

                    <li><strong>application:</strong> Application scope contains data for the entire web
                        application.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>none:</strong> No scope is selected.</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Bean Description:</strong> Sets a description for the JSF managed bean.</li>
        </ul>
