DESC_TooStrongCast=Reports type casts, which are too strict and casting to a more general type would be sufficient for \
    the actual expression. Sometimes, an instance is casted to a specific subtype, but methods \
    invoked or fields used from the casted instance are actually defined by some supertype. In that case \
    cast to too specific type introduces an unnecessary coupling to the code and limits its extensibility. \
    <p/>\
    This inspection will suggest to use the most general type which would satisfy the expression's needs.
