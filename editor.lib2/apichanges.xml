INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

        <change id="added-component-removed-property">
            <summary>EditorRegistry.COMPONENT_REMOVED_PROPERTY added.</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="13"/>
            <date day="1" month="7" year="2009"/>

        <change id="added-dialogbinding">
            <summary>DialogBinding added</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="11"/>
            <date day="15" month="5" year="2009"/>
            <author login="dbalek"/>
            <compatibility binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" addition="yes"/>
            <description>DialogBinding allows for content of some text component to be virtually placed
                to the given offset inside of a file or document. This way, the necessary context is
                provided for code completion and similar features to work in any text component.

            <description>
                EditorActionRegistration allows to easily register an editor action
                into the list of actions of an editor kit. It also allows a lazy
                action's class loading (more details in javadoc).

        <change id="added-codegen-spi">
            <summary>Code Generation SPI added</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="8"/>
            <date day="30" month="4" year="2008"/>
            <author login="dbalek"/>
            <compatibility binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" addition="yes"/>
            <description>
                The Code Generation SPI consists of two interfaces.
                The <code>CodeGenerator</code> implementations registered for
                various mime types serve for creating code snippets and inserting
                them into documents on the Insert Code editor action invocation.
                The <code>CodeGeneratorContextProvider</code> implementations
                registered for the mime types could provide the respective
                CodeGenerators with an additional context information.

        <change id="added-HighlightAttributeValue">
            <summary>HighlightAttributeValue interface added</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="5"/>
            <date day="13" month="9" year="2007"/>
            <author login="vstejskal"/>
            <compatibility binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" addition="yes"/>
            <description>
                The <code>HighlightAttributeValue</code> allows specifying highlights
                with attributes, which value is lazily evaluated at the time when
                the attrbute is used. For example when specifying tooltips.

        <change id="added-EditorRegistry">

            <date day="7" month="6" year="2007"/>
            <author login="mmetelka"/>
            <compatibility binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" addition="yes"/>
            <description>
                The <code>EditorRegistry</code> allows to get focused and last focused text component
                and list of all registered components and it allows to listen for currently focused
                component and changes of documents in it.

                The <code>AttributesUtilities</code> class has been moved to
