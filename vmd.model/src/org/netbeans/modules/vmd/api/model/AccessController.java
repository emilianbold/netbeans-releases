 * on all registered AccessController classes, then performed all event firing for all listeners, and finally
 * notifyEventFired method is called on all registered AccessController classes.

 * This interface is used to listen on document change and you need to lock additional lock or mutex
 * or some initialization/finalization code must performed before/after the event firing.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Be aware that the creation of this class is called when a DesignDocument is creating,
 * do not perform any action which may call/use DesignDocument since the document is not initialized yet.
