/**
 * This presenter is designed to allow receiving notification about document changes.
 * <p>
 * When a presenter is really attached to a component, then notifyAttached method is called to notify it. Therefore
 * perform all initialization inside that method. Similarly notifyDetached is called when a presenter is dettached
 * from a component.
 * <p>
 * When a design is changed, designChanged method is called on a presenter. The getEventFilter method is called once
 * after notifyAttached method is called, for resolving the filter that is used for the design-changed listening.
 * If the presenter changes internally (based on design-changed or other way), it has to call firePresenterChanged method
 * to notify the model about it.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to use have a dependencies between presenters e.g. a presenter requires additional data
 * from other presenter for its own work. For that purpose there are addDependency and removeDependency methods that could
 * be called from notifyAttached and notifyDetached. When a presenter is no longer used, that all its dependencies are
 * automatically removed.
 * <p>
 * When at least one of the dependent presenters (those that this presenter has a dependency on), is changed, presenterChanged
 * method is called. At the time of the method call, presenterChanged methods on all the dependent presenters are called
 * (this means all dependent presenters are resolved).
 * When a presenter fires a presenter-changed event, the presenterChanged method is called automatically called too.
