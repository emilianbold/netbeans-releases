/**
 * The class represents a document change event. There is an only one event type for document changes. The class tracks
 * all types of changes. Types of changes are: Any change of a property value, components hierarchy, or selection.
 * <p>
 * The event also contains all values of property values. These old values are one that were store at the begining of the transaction.
 * When a property is overriden many times, only the newest value is stored in the document and the oldest value is stored
 * in the event.
 * <p>
 * When a component hierarchy is changed, the event remembers which components were affected during the transaction.
 * The newest hierarchy is stored in the document. There is no way how to resolve state before the transaction. Also
 * when a component is removed from and then added back to structure, so hierarchy is the same as before, an event is fired
 * anyway and the component and its parent are marked as hierarchy-modified.
 * <p>
 * When a component is created, the event remembers all those components that were created during the transaction.
