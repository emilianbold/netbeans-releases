<h2>OQL Console</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The OQL Console is a tab in the Heap window that is available when you load a snapshot of the heap.
    The OQL Console enables you to write, execute and save queries that are used to locate 
    information from the Java heap.
</p>
<p>You can open a heap snapshot by choosing Profile &gt; Load Heap Dump from the main menu and specifying the location of the heap dump.
    You can also open saved heap snapshots from the Profiler window.</p>

<p>The OQL Console contains the following panes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Query Results.</b> This pane displays the results of the OQL query. 
    Click the result to examine the details of the object in the Heap window.</li>
    <li><b>Query Editor.</b> This pane enables you to write and edit OQL queries.
    When you open a Saved Query the query is also displayed in this pane.
    You can save custom queries that you might want to run again.</li>
    <li><b>Saved Queries.</b> This pane displays saved sample OQL queries that
    are included with the IDE. To run a sample query, select the query in the list and
    click Open to open the query and then Click Execute in the Query Editor pane.
    <p>You can select a saved query and click Properties to view additional details about the query.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can use any of the sample OQL queries or create a query to filter and select heap data to
    locate the information that you want from the Java heap.
    After you choose or write a query, you can run the query against the Java heap and view the results.</p>
