        <h2>Select Snapshots to Compare Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Select Snapshots to Compare dialog box enables you to select 
        two memory snapshots that are located on your local system.
        Click the Browse button to locate the memory snapshots that you 
        want to compare.
        Click OK to view a comparison of the snapshots in the Memory Snapshot Comparison window.</p>
        
        <p>You open this dialog box by choosing Profile &gt; Compare Memory Snapshots 
        from the main menu.</p>
        
        <p>When you choose the memory snapshots that you want to compare, 
        the memory snapshots must be of the same type and contain similar details. 
        You will see a warning in the dialog box if the snapshots are not the same type.
        There are two types of memory snapshots, and the type of snapshot
        will depend upon the option that was selected for the profiling session
        when the snapshot was taken.</p>
        
        <p>You cannot compare CPU snapshots.
        When you are locating snapshots in the file browser, 
        the snapshot file type for memory snapshots and CPU snapshots is
        indicated by <tt>.nps</tt> appended to the file name.
        You will not be able to identify the type of snapshot by the file name in the file browser
        if you used the default names that were generated by the IDE  when you saved the snapshots.</p>
