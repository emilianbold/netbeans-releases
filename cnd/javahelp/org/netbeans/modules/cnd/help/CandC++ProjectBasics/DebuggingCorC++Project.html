<p>
Debugging is the process of examining your application for errors. 
The process of debugging is accomplished by setting breakpoints and 
watches in your code and running it in the debugger. Debugging enables 
you to execute your code one line at a time and examine the state 
of your application in order to discover any problems.
</p>
<p>The IDE uses the <tt>gdb</tt> debugger 
to debug your C and C++ applications.  
</p>
<p>If the tools required to build and debug the project are not in the tool
collection specified for the project, the Options window opens with 
the Build Tools tab indicating which tools are missing. Resolve the missing 
tools and click OK.
</p>
<p>If you are running a C/C++ project from existing sources and you
did not specify a build result when you created the project, the 
Select Executable dialog box opens so that you can select 
the executable to run.
