<h2>C and C++ Debugger Windows</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
Whenever you start a debugging session, the IDE opens debugging 
windows below the editing area. Each debugger window has a tab and 
shares space with the Output window. You can open any debugger 
window by choosing Window &gt; Debugging &gt; window-name (for example, 
View > Debugging > Breakpoints).
</p>
<p>
A set of debugger windows opens automatically when you start a 
debugging session. The Watches, Local Variables, and Call Stack 
windows open by default with every debugging session. You can open 
any other debugger window by choosing View &gt; Debugging &gt; window-name.
In each debugger window, information is organized into lists. 
Each list item represents a single object. Each column represents a 
property of the object. Data displayed in blue underlined text is 
linked to the source code.
</p>
<p>Each debugger window displays a variety of icons to relay 
information about the object. For example, the Breakpoints window 
uses a small red square to indicate a breakpoint set on a line. Some 
windows also include a node expansion control in the left column. 
Clicking this control expands and collapses the object.
</p>
<p>
Some elements of a window's list have editable properties, such as 
the value property of a variable in the Local Variables window. If you 
select a property and the property has a white background, then you 
can edit the property. A selected property with a gray background 
cannot be edited.
</p>
<p>
In a debugger window's list, you can size a column to fit its 
contents by dragging the column border in the title header. You can move a column by 
dragging the column's title header. Clicking the icon to the right of the column 
titles opens a dialog box that provides a list of all possible 
columns that can be shown. Using this dialog box, you can choose to 
show or hide a column of information. 
</p>
<p>Each window also includes a pop-up menu, which you open by 
right-clicking inside the window. Most items in this menu apply to 
the selected object. One menu item, List Options, opens a submenu 
with commands for operating on the list, including which column 
the list is sorted on and whether the objects in the list are 
sorted in ascending or descending order. Clicking the column header 
is another way to switch the sort order between ascending and 
descending order.
