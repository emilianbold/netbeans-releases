<h2>C and C++ Call Stack Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
The Call Stack window lists the sequence of function calls made during 
execution of the current thread. By default, the Call Stack window 
opens automatically whenever you start a debugging session.
You can open the Call Stack window by choosing Window &gt; 
Debugging &gt; Call Stack.
</p>
<p>
If you open the Call Stack window when a debugging session is 
running, it closes automatically when you end the debugging session.
If you open the window when no debugging session is running, the window
stays open until you close it.
</p>
<p>
The information given for each call includes the name of the function, 
followed by the filename and line number of the function's currently
executing statement. If you double-click the function, the editor
jumps to the function in your source code.
</p>
The initial function, <tt>main()</tt> for C and C++ programs, is at the
bottom of the Call Stack window. The function that was executing when the
program stopped is at the top of the window. This function is known 
as the stopped-in function.
</p>
<p>One call is the current call. By default, this call is the most 
recent call made by the current thread. When you select a different 
current thread in the Threads window, the Call Stack window is updated
to show the calls 
for that thread. The values of variables in the Variables
window are adjusted for the context of the current call.
</p>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>The following table describes the icons displayed to the left of the
call name.
