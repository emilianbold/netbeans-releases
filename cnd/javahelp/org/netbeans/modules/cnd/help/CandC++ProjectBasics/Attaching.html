<h2>Attaching the Debugger to a Running Process</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
If you want to debug a project that is already running, you can
attach the debugger to the project's running process. You must select
the process and the associated project to enable the debugger to display source
files along with the debugging information.
</p>
<p>
You might want to attach the debugger to a running process under 
the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
To debug a running server without stopping or killing it
</li>
<li>
To debug a running GUI program without restarting it
</li>
<li>To debug a program that is looping indefinitely without 
killing it
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To attach the debugger to a running process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Debug &gt; Attach Debugger.
<p>The Attach dialog box opens displaying a list of all of your 
currently active processes.
</p>
</li>
<li>If you want to filter the list of processes, type the string 
you want to match in the Filter text box.
</li>
<li>Select the process to which you want to attach the debugger.
</li>
<li>The Project drop-down list includes all open projects. 
Select the project that 
represents the process to which you are attaching. If the selected
project does not match the process to which you are attaching, the
attach is aborted.
</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>
