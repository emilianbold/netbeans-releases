<h2>Current Context in the Debugger</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
The current context is the portion of your program on which the 
debugger is currently focusing. When multiple sessions are running, 
only one session is current. 
<!--Within the current session, the thread 
from which the debugger regained control is the default current 
thread. Inside the current thread, the most recent call is the 
default current call.
-->
</p>
<p>
You can make any session or call current by right-clicking 
its node in the appropriate debugger window and choosing Make 
Current.
</p>
<h3>
Debugger Windows and Context</h3>
Most debugger windows depend on the current context. When you 
change the current context, the contents of these windows are 
updated to reflect the new context.
<p>
For example, the Call Stack window shows the call stack for the 
current thread and the Variables window shows the variables that 
are local to the current call.
</p>
<p>
The exceptions are the Breakpoints and Watches windows. These 
windows list all breakpoints and watches set in the IDE. While the 
set of watches is shared by all sessions, an individual watch 
expression is evaluated and displayed based on the current context.
</p>
<h3>The Source Editor and Context</h3>
When a variable is active in the current context, the Source Editor 
displays the value of the variable when you move the pointer over it.
In cases where a program includes different variables with the same name,
the Source Editor displays the value based on the current context, and
not on the instance of the variable in the source code.
