       You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt; Options and clicking the C/C++ category.
    </p>
    <p>
       The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project settings, code
      assistance settings, highlighting settings, and accepted file extensions for your C and C++
      projects. These options are used as default values for new C and C++ projects. Some of these
      settings can be overridden on individual projects by <a href=
      "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/SettingCandC++ProjectProperties.html">setting project
      properties</a>.

       <b>Development Host</b>. The list includes your local host and any remote hosts you have
      defined. You can add and remove remote development hosts, change the default host, and
      specify how to share project sources on the local host with the remote host. For information
      on using remote hosts, see <a href=
      "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, click Add.
        The New Remote Development Host wizard starts. See the help for the <a href=
        "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">New Remote
        Development Host wizard</a> for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        To set a host as the default development host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager
        dialog box, select the host, click Set as Default, then click OK. This host is used by
        default for new projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, select the
        host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        To map shared project sources on the local host to a remote host, click Edit. In the
        Development Host Manager dialog box, click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog box,
        select the remote host in the Host list. For each mapping, in the Local Path field, type
        the path used to access the shared project sources from the local host. In the Remote Path
        field, type the path used to access the shared project sources from the remote host.
      </li>
      <li>
        To change IDE properties related to the remote development host, click Properties. In the
        Host Properties dialog box, you can change the name displayed in the IDE for the host by
        typing in the Name field. To change the way project files are shared with the remote host,
        select the file synchronization method in the Synchronization list. If the project files
        are in a shared folder accessible from the local host and remote host, select File System
        Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select Smart Secure Copy to copy the files.
        The files are copied to your <tt>.netbeans</tt> directory on the remote host.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
      currently selected development host. The default collection for that selected host is listed
      in bold type. You can modify the tool collection list by adding or removing collections. Be
      sure to select the Development Host before you modify any information about the tool
      collection.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add New
        Tool Set dialog box. The base directory is usually a <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory. The Tool
        Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically by the IDE after it analyzes the
        tools in the base directory. You can specify a different name for the collection. If you
        change the family, make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the
        collection or the compiler flags might not be valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
        directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default. The default
        collection is used by default for new projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      <li>
        <b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. Always Relative mode
        stores paths as relative to the project root. Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute
        paths. Auto mode stores paths as relative to the project root if inside the project,
        otherwise as absolute path.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, saves all unsaved files in
        the IDE before running make. It is recommended to leave this property selected because
        modifications to files in the IDE are not recognized by make unless they are first saved to
        disk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
        single Output window tab, deleting the output from the previous process. If not selected,
        opens a new tab for each make process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add <tt>make state</tt>
        statements to the makefile.

      <li>
        <b>Show binary files in Projects view.</b> If selected, the Projects view shows all files
        in a directory tree, including binary objects. This option is most relevant to projects
        created with existing sources, which might place sources and binaries in the same location.
        Deselect this option to more easily see your C/C++ source files and header files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show profiler indicators during run (new projects only).</b> If selected, profiler tools
        such as CPU Usage and Memory Usage are set up to run by default when newly created projects
        are run. The tools that are shown are determined by the Profile Configuration selected in
        Tools &gt; Profiler Tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show warning dialog about missing makefiles due to mismatched platforms.</b> If
        selected, the IDE will warn you if you attempt to run a project that was created on a
        platform that is not the same as your current development host's platform.

        identifiers are highlighted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reparse on File Change.</b> If this option is selected, your project is reparsed
        whenever files are modified. Normally this option should be enabled for code assistance to
        work correctly. However, if the project is very large, reparsing might cause delays, so you
        can deselect this option and reparse manually. Right-click the project and select Code
        Assistance &gt; Reparse Project.
      </li>
      <li>
