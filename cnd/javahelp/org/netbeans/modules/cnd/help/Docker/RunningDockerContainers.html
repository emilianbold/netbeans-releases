    <h2>
      Running Docker Containers
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. A Docker container consists of the following
    components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Docker image</li>
      <li>An execution environment</li>
      <li>A standard set of instructions</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><b>To Run Docker Containers:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the services window, right click on the image you want to run and select Run.</li>
      <li>In Container Properties, fill in the Name, Command, and User fields.</li>
      <li>Select the options that you want to use and then click Next.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Keep STDIN open even if not attached</b> (-i, --interactive)
          <p>When set to true, keep stdin open even if not attached.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Allocate a pseudo-TTY</b> (-t or --tty flag)
          <p>When set to true, Docker can allocate a pseudo-tty and attach to
            the standard input of any container. For example, this can be used to run a throwaway 
            interactive shell. The default is false.</p></li>
        <li><b>Run in privileged mode</b> (--privileged)
          <p>Gives extended privileges to this container. A <i>privileged</i> container
            is given access to all devices.</p>
          <p>By default, Docker containers are <i>unprivileged</i> and cannot run a Docker daemon 
            inside the Docker container. This is because, by default, a container is not allowed
            to access any devices.</p></li>
        <li><b>Mount Volumes</b> (-v or --volume)
          <p>Creates a bind mount. When you specify the Source and Target directories, 
            Docker bind mounts Source directory in the host to Target directory in the Docker container.</p></li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Specify the Port Bindings property during the Run Image action. You can view the port 
        bindings by selecting View Port Bindings on the running container.</li>
    </ol>
      <p>For more information on Port Bindings, see 
        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/binding/"
          <b>Bind container ports to the host</b></a> on the Docker Documentation website.</p>
    <p>The mount volume table enables you to specify the directory on
      the host Docker machine that you want to mount into a container.</p>
