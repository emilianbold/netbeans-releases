    <h2>
       Using a Remote Development Host
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can build, run, and debug projects on the local host (the system from which you started
      the IDE) or on a remote host running a Linux or Solaris operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create a project, the default development host is selected as the development host
      for the project. You can change the development host for the project on the Build panel of
      the Project Properties dialog box. You can also right-click a project node and select Set
      Remote Development Host.
    </p>
    <p>
       You can define remote development hosts in the Build Tools tab of the <a href=
      "../CandC++ProjectBasics/CandC++Options.html">Options window</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       To develop a project on a remote host, both the remote host and local host must have access
      to the project files. File access can be accomplished in several ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep the project on a shared folder or filesystem that is visible on both the local host
        and the remote host. Typically such a filesystem is shared using NFS or Samba. You can
        define the mapping between local and remote paths to project source files when you define
        the remote host. See <a href="RemoteDevelopmentFileSharing.html">File Sharing with Remote Development Hosts</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Smart Secure Copy option to copy files to the remote host. The files will be copied
        to the .netbeans/remote subdirectory located in your home user directory on the remote host.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You can select the file synchronization strategy when you define the remote host, after you
      connect to the host in the New Remote Development Host wizard. You can change the
      synchronization any time by going to the Manage Hosts dialog. Right-click project node, and
      select Set Remote Development Host &gt; Manage Hosts. Select the hostname and click
      Properties.
    </p>
    <p>
       After you have set up a remote development host, you can use it as your build machine simply
      by selecting the remote development host in your project properties. Then you can use the IDE
      to build your project in the same way you do locally. The advantage of remote development is
      that you can gain access to compilers and tools that you might not have on your local host.
      The remote server may also have more robust hardware, such as multicore processors to enable
      parallel processing of your builds.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you have a remote machine running the Solaris 10 OS or OpenSolaris OS, you can take
      advantage of the IDE's <a href=
      "../ProfilingCandC++Projects/OverviewOfCandC++Profiling.html">C/C++ profiling tools</a> that
      are supported on Solaris operating systems.
