    <h2>
       Configuring Project Options for C/C++/Fortran Projects
    </h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp;</small>
    </p>
    <p>
       You can use the Options window to configure some general project options for your
       C, C++, and Fortran projects. These options affect all your C/C++/Fortan projects,
       and are mostly related to makefiles and behavior related to building and running
       your projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To configure general project options:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose Tools &gt; Options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click C/C++ in the top pane of the window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the Project Options tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify the properties as desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       You can set the following properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Make Options.</b> Global options for the <tt>make</tt> command.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. Always Relative mode
        stores paths as relative to project root. Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute
        paths. Auto mode stores paths as relative to project root if inside project, othervise as
        absolute path.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, saves all unsaved files in
        the IDE before running make. It is recommended to leave this property selected because
        modifications to files in the IDE are not recognized by make unless they are first saved to
        disk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
        single Output window tab, deleting the output from the previous process. If not selected,
        opens a new tab for each make process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add <tt>make state</tt>
        statements to the makefile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show binary files in Projects view.</b> If selected, the Projects view shows all files
        in a directory tree, including binary objects. This option is most relevant to projects
        created with existing sources, which might place sources and binaries in the same location.
        Deselect this option to more easily see your C/C++ source files and header files.
      </li>
    <li>
        <b>Show profiler indicators during run (new projects only).</b> If selected, profiler tools
        such as CPU Usage and Memory Usage are set up to run by default when newly created projects
        are run. The tools that are shown are determined by the <a href="ManagingProjectConfigurations.html"
        Profile Configuration</a> selected in Tools &gt; Profiler Tools.
      </li>
  <li>
        <b>Show warning dialog about missing makefiles due to mismatched platforms.</b> If
        selected, the IDE will warn you if you attempt to run a project that was created on a
        platform that is not the same as your current development host's platform. If you use
        project configurations to build on multiple platforms, you might want to disable the
        missing makefiles warning.
      </li>
