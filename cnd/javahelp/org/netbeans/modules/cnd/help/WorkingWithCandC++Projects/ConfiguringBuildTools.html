       Configuring Build Tools for C/C++/Fortran Projects
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE uses the build tools (compilers, debuggers, make utility) that are installed on your system,
       or on a remote system that you set up as a remote development host.
       You can use the Options window to configure build tools for your C/C++/Fortran projects. The options
       that you specify are used by default for all new C/C++/Fortran projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       <b>To configure build tools:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Choose Tools &gt; Options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click C/C++ in the top pane of the window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the Build Tools tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modify the properties as desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       You can set the following properties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Development Host.</b> The Development Host list includes your local host and any remote
        hosts you have defined. For information on using remote hosts, see <a href=
        "RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>. You can add and remove remote development
        hosts, change the default host, and change IDE properties of remote development
        hosts.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, click
            Add. The New Remote Development Host wizard starts. See the help for the <a href=
            "NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">New Remote Development Host wizard</a> for more
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, select
            the host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set a host as the default development host, select the host from the Development
            Host list and click Set as Default.
          </li>
         
          <li>
            To change IDE properties related to a remote development host, click Edit. In the Development
            Host Manager dialog box, select the host you want to change and click Properties. In
            the Host Properties dialog box, you can change the name displayed in the IDE for the
            host by typing in the Display Name field. To change the way project files are shared with the
            remote host, select the file synchronization method in the Synchronization list. If the
            project files are in a shared folder that is accessible from the local host and remote host, you can
            select File System Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select Smart Secure Copy
            to copy the files. The files are copied using SSH protocols to your .netbeans directory on the remote host by default.
            
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
        current development host and the local host. The default collection is listed in bold type.
        This collection is selected by default for any new project you create. You can change the
        default tool collection for a specific project in the project properties. You can
        manually add and remove tool collections.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add
            New Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in
            automatically. You can specify a different name for the collection. If you change the
            family, make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the collection
            or the compiler flags might not be valid.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
          </li>
          <li>
            To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
            directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box. This might be useful if
            you have two releases of the same tool collection. You can edit the path to the base directory
            in the duplicate tool collection to specify the path to the other release.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers for the current development host. The
        base directory is often the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the tool collection.
      </li>
      <li style=" list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>C Compiler.</b> The path to the C compiler to use for building projects. The default compiler is
            the first one found in the base directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>C++ Compiler.</b> The path to the C++ compiler to use for building projects. The default
            compiler is the first one found in the base directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The path to the Fortran compiler to use for building projects. The default
            compiler is the first one found in the base directory.
          </li>
          <li><b>Assembler.</b> The path to the assembler program to use for translating assembly instructions.</li>
         </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make Command.</b> The path to the make command to use for building projects. The default command is
        the first one found in the base directory. To select a different command from the base
        directory or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different command
        in the Select Tool dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Debugger Command.</b> The path to the gdb command to use when debugging projects. The default
        command is the first one found in the base directory. To select a different command from
        the base directory or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a
        different command in the Select Tool dialog box.
      </li>
      <li><b>QMake Command.</b> The path to the qmake command, which is used to generate makefiles
          for Qt projects.</li>
      <li><b>CMake Command.</b> The path to the cmake command to use for projects with existing
      sources that use the CMake cross compiler.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       To display the versions of all of the selected tools, click Versions.
    </p>
    <p>
       To restore all of the tool selections to the defaults, click Restore Defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
       To set the build tools properties for a specific project, right-click the project and choose
      Properties.
