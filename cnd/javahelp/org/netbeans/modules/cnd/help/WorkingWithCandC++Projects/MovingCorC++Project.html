<h2>Moving, Copying, or Renaming a C or C++ Project</h2>
<p>When you create a project, the IDE bases much of its project metadata 
on the name and location of the project. These values are used in the project 
properties, and the names and locations of the project folders. In order to safely move, 
copy, and rename a project, you must use the commands provided by the IDE.
</p>
<p><b>To move, copy, or rename a project:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose one of the 
following commands:
<ul>
<li>Rename Project</li>
<li>Move Project</li>
<li>Copy Project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Moving and renaming a project can break dependencies between projects. To fix the 
project dependencies, remove the renamed or moved projects from the required 
projects for any other projects, and then add them again.
