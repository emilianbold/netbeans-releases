<h2>Folding Blocks of Code in C and C++ Files</h2>
<p>
For some types of files, you can use the code folding feature to collapse 
blocks of code so that only the first line of the block appears in the Source 
Editor.
</p>
<p>
A block of code that can be folded is indicated by a collapse icon
<img src="../images/cf_minus.gif">&nbsp;to the left of the first line of the block. A vertical line extends from the 
collapse icon to the bottom of the foldable code. A block of code that is 
already folded is indicated by an expand icon 
<img src="../images/cf_plus.gif">&nbsp;to left of the 
code block. You can expand and collapse folds by clicking expand and collapse 
icons or by right-clicking in the code itself and choosing from the Code Folds 
pop-up menu.
</p>
<p>
You can mouse over the folded block to quickly display the code in the block.
</p>
<p>
For C and C++ files, you can fold:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Block comments at topmost level
</li>
<li>Several subsequent line comments at topmost level
</li>
<li>
All levels of function definitions
</li>
<li>Preprocessor conditionals such as <tt>#ifdef</tt>, <tt>#if</tt>, 
<tt>#else</tt>, and <tt>#endif</tt>
</li>
<li>All levels of classes, unions, structs, and enums
</li>
</ul>
