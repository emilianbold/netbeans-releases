<h2>Refactoring Source Files</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
<p>You can rename some or all occurrences of an element in your project.</p>
<p><b>To find and rename an element in your project:</b>

<ul>
<li>Right-click an occurrence of the element in a source file in the Source Editor 
and choose Refactor &gt; Rename.</li>
<li>Right-click an element in the Navigator window and choose Rename.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Rename dialog box, type the new name in the New Name test field and click 
Preview.</li>
<li>The <a href="RefactoringWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> opens with a tree view of the occurrences of the 
element  
in your project on the left, and a split panel showing the selected source file and the 
refactored source file on the right.</li>   
<li>To rename all occurrences of the element in your project, click Do Refactoring.
</li>
<li>If you 
want to change only some of the occurrences of the element, deselect the checkboxes 
in the tree view for the files in which you do not want it changed, or the individual 
occurrences that you do not want changed. Then click Do Refactoring to change only the 
occurrences that are still selected.
