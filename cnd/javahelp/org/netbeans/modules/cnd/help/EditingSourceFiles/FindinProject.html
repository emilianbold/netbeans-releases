<h2>Find in Projects Dialog Box</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Find in Projects dialog box lets you search 
projects for instances of specified text or a regular 
expression.
</p>
<p>To open the Find in Projects dialog box, choose Edit > 
Find in Projects, or right-click a 
project in the Projects window and choose Find.
</p>
<p>
The Find in Projects dialog box contains two tabs, 
Default Search and Grep. 
The Default Search tab uses the default search utility. 
The Grep tab uses the <tt>grep</tt> 
utility, which provides a faster search, especially for 
remote projects.
