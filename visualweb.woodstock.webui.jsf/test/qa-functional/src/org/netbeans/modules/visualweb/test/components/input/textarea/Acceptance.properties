textValue2=Welcome to Creator! Creator is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that helps you build web applications. While many IDEs out in the world do that, Creator is unique in that it is built on a layered technology anchored in Java. At the core of this technology is the Java programming language. Java includes a compiler that produces portable bytecode and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs this byte code on any processor. Java is an important part of Creator because it makes your web applications portable. But Java is more than just a programming language. It is also a technology platform. 
Many large systems have been developed that use Java as their core. These systems are highly scalable and provide services and structure that address some of the high-volume, distributed computing environments of today.
