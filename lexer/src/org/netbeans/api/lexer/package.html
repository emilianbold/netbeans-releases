    The entrance point into Lexer API is
    {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.TokenHierarchy} class with
    its static methods that provide its instance for the given input source.
    <br/>
    {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.TokenHierarchy#tokenSequence()}
    allows to walk through the tokens that were created for the given input.
    <br/>
    {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.Token} models a single token recognized in the input.
    It carries a token identification {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.TokenId} returned by
    {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.Token#id()}
    and token text represented as {@link java.lang.CharSequence}
    returned by {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.Token#text()}.
    <br/>
    {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.Language} represents
    all the token ids for a single language.
    <br/>
    Each token id may belong to one or more token categories that allow to better operate
    tokens of the same type (e.g. keywords or operators).
