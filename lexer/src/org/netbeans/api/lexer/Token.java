/**
 * Token describes a lexical element of input text.

 * It mainly provides an identification by {@link #id()}
 * and a textual body (aka token's image) by {@link #text()}.
 * <br/>
 * Only lexers should produce token instances and they should do it
 * solely by using methods of {@link org.netbeans.spi.lexer.TokenFactory}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b><font color="red">
 * Do not create custom extensions of this class - lexers may only return
 * implementations produced by <code>TokenFactory</code>.
 * Creation of any other token implementations will be refused.
 * </font>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Token guarantees stability of the {@link #id()} and {@link #length()} methods.
 * The {@link #hashCode()} and {@link #equals(Object)} methods
 * use the default implementations from <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
 * <br/>
 * The two tokens are only equal if they are the same object.
