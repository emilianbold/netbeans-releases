<h2>About Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Design patterns handle software design problems that occur over and over again. Each pattern is a general, UML-based solution that addresses a specific design problem in object-oriented systems. The design patterns are generic arrangements of objects and classes that solve the problem. You can use a pattern repeatedly as the basis for unique solutions. </p>
<p>The IDE's UML Modeling feature offers several standard design patterns in the UML Design Center, as well as ways to create and apply your own patterns. </p>
