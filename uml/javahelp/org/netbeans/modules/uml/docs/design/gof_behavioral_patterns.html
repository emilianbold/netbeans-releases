<h2>GoF Behavioral Patterns</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>GoF (Gang of Four) behavioral patterns are concerned with the algorithms of objects and the assignment of responsibilities among objects. These patterns also address communication between these objects and represent the interconnection between the objects themselves. This interconnection can include inheritance and the performance of tasks. </p>
<p>The table below describes each of the GoF behavioral patterns:</p>

<td rowspan="3">Chain of Responsibility</td>
<td rowspan="3">By giving more than one object a chance to handle a request, you can avoid coupling the sender of that request to its receiver. The receiving objects are chained and the request is passed along that chain until an object handles it.</td>

<td>Defines an abstract interface used for specific requests</td>
</tr>

<td>Client</td>
<td>Initiates communication via a Concrete Handle </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="5">Command Pattern</td>
<td rowspan="5">You can parameterize clients with different requests by encapsulating a request as an object. You can also queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. </td>
<td>Command</td>
<td>Defines an abstract interface for operation execution.</td>
