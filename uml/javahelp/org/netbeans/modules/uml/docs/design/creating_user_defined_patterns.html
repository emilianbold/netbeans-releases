<h2>Creating User-Defined Patterns</h2>
<p>When searching for an answer to your design problem, you might find that none of the standard patterns included in the UML Design Center provide the solution you are looking for. The UML Modeling feature gives you ways to create your own pattern, document it, apply it, and share it with others. </p>
<p>Before building your pattern, decide where to create it. Patterns can be created so that they appear right in your Projects window, or they can be created in the UML Design Center window. A pattern appearing in the Projects window can be applied only to elements in that project, unless the pattern is <a href="promoting_patterns_to_design_center.html">promoted</a> to the UML Design Center. Patterns that are created or promoted to the UML Design Center can be applied to any project. </p>
<p>If you decide to create your pattern in the UML Design Center, see <a href="creating_user_defined_projects.html">Creating User-Defined Projects</a>. Otherwise, you can begin building your pattern so that it appears in the Projects window. </p>
<p>Creating a user-defined pattern involves three processes:</p>
