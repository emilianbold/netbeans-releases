<h2>Building a User-Defined Pattern</h2>
<p>Once you have <a href="creating_diagram_for_user_defined_pattern.html">created a diagram</a>, you are ready to build your pattern. This example covers building the Intercepting Filter pattern from the core J2EE patterns catalog. </p>
<p>First, be familiar with the types of modeling elements that are used when building patterns. The following table describes the usage for each of the element types:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Icon</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Name</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/design-pattern.png" alt="Design Pattern icon"></td>
<td>Design Pattern</td>
<td>Denotes a commonly-recurring structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within a particular context.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/part-facade-actor.png" alt="Actor Role icon"></td>
<td>Actor Role</td>
<td>Denotes an actor's role in the pattern. When applying the pattern to existing elements, only actors may be selected, or a new actor may be created to satisfy the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/part-facade-class.png" alt="Class Role icon"></td>
<td>Class Role</td>
<td>Denotes the role of a class in the pattern. When applying the pattern to existing elements, only classes may be selected, or a new class may be created to satisfy the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/classifier-role.png" alt="Classifier Role icon"></td>
<td>Classifier Role</td>
<td>Denotes a classifier's role in the pattern. When applying the pattern to existing elements, only actors, classes, interfaces or use cases may be selected. If a new element is created, the type to be created is based on the Type to Create preference.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/interface.png" alt="Interface Role icon"></td>
<td>Interface Role</td>
<td>Denotes an interface's role in the pattern. When applying the pattern to existing elements, only interfaces may be selected, or a new interface may be created to satisfy the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/part-facade-use-case.png" alt="Use Case Role icon"></td>
<td>Use Case Role</td>
<td>Denotes a use case's role in the pattern. When applying the pattern to existing elements, only use cases may be selected, or a new use case may be created to satisfy the role.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/connector.png" alt="Role Binding icon"></td>
<td>Role Binding</td>
<td>Indicates that a role is participating in a pattern.</td>
</tr>

<p>Using the diagram below as a reference, you can build the InterceptingFilter pattern. Use the steps following the diagram to create the design pattern. </p>
<p><img src="../images/Pattern.gif" alt="Graphic displaying the Intercepting Filter pattern diagram"></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Modeling Palette, click the Design Pattern icon <img src="../images/resources/images/design-pattern.png" alt="Design Pattern icon"> and click in the diagram.</li>
<li>Name the pattern <tt>InterceptingFilter</tt>.
<ul>
<li>You can immediately type the name of the pattern into the element.</li>
<li>OR</li>
<li>You can use the Properties window to name and modify the pattern.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the Modeling Palette, click the Class Role icon <img src="../images/resources/images/part-facade-class.png" alt="Class Role icon">.</li>
<li>Click once on the pattern, drag the cursor to an area adjacent to the pattern, and click again.<br>
The role is placed on the diagram and is automatically linked to the pattern.
<ul class="note">
<li>You can also associate the roles with the pattern by using the Role Binding icon on the toolbar.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Name the role <tt>FilterTwo</tt>.</li>
<li>Continue until you have added all seven class roles to the diagram and named them.</li>
<li>In the Modeling Palette, click the Association icon <img src="../images/resources/images/class-association.png" alt="Association icon">, click the Target role, and click the FilterManager role.<br>
An association is created between the two roles.</li>
<li>Continue adding associations until your diagram appears as in the example.
<p>Now the pattern is complete. In many patterns, you may want to add attributes or operations to your roles. You can add those just as you would add them to ordinary classes. See <a href="../diagrams/class_ww_attributes.html">Working With Attributes</a> and <a href="../diagrams/class_ww_operations.html">Working With Operations</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>(Optional) You can <a href="../basics/documenting_objects.html">document</a> your pattern for future reference.</li>
<li>Save your project by right-clicking the project node and choosing Save. </li>
</ol>
<p>You have finished building your design pattern. Now you can <a href="applying_patterns.html">apply the pattern</a> to your project or <a href="promoting_patterns_to_design_center.html">promote</a> it to the UML Design Center.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>While creating your pattern, you might want to be able to add multiple elements with the same properties and relationships--for example, one class that inherits from two other classes. To create two classes with the same properties and relationships, you add a multiplicity range to the participant. See <a href="allowing_multiple_participants.html">Allowing the Creation of Multiple Participants</a>.</li>
