<title>Selecting All Similar Elements (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Selecting All Similar Elements</h2>
<p>You can select all components or links of a given type in a UML Diagram window. When you select a single component or link (by clicking it), the IDE displays handles around the selected graphic. Likewise, when you select all similar components or links, the IDE displays handles around every component or link of the same type in the window, letting you cut, copy, delete, or otherwise work with them all at once. For example, when you click an actor in a Class diagram, and then select all similar components, the IDE selects all other actor components in the target window.</p>
<p><b>To select all similar elements in a Diagram window:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the target component, and choose Select All Similar Elements.<br>
The IDE selects all similar components (or links) in the window, displaying handles around each selected component.</li>
</ul>
