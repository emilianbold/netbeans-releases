<h2>Deleting Diagram Elements</h2>
<p>The IDE lets you use either of two methods to delete UML modeling elements. </p>
<ul class="note">
<li>To prevent you from accidentally deleting an element from the Diagram editor, the IDE gives you a deletion confirmation message. A deleted element is not placed on the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To delete an element from the Diagram editor:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Diagram editor, click an element.</li>
<li>Right-click the element and choose Edit &gt; Delete.<br>
The IDE displays the Delete confirmation message.</li>
<li>(Optional) To permanently delete the element from the project, select the 
<tt>Deletion will permanently delete elements from project</tt> checkbox.</li>
<li>Click Yes.<br>
The IDE deletes the component from the diagram, and, if appropriate, from the project permanently.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To delete an element from the Projects window:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click an element and choose Delete.<br>
    The IDE deletes the element from the project and from all associated diagrams.</li>
</ul>
