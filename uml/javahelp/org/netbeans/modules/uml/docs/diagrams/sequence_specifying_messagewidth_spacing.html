<h2>Specifying the Message Width Spacing Restriction</h2>
<p>When you want to restrict the mobility of any two Sequence diagram lifelines so that the width between them is the same as their message width, you can specify an automatically expanding space between the target lifelines by:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the Sequence diagram, between the target lifelines, right-click the gray bar, and then choose Set Width to Message Width. Make sure you have selected the two lifelines. <br>
The IDE applies the restriction, and displays between the target lifelines a straight line with curved, vertical ends.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>When you want to move any two restricted Sequence diagram lifelines freely around their diagram, you can remove any spacing restrictions between them by doing the following:
  <ul>
      <li>At the top of the Sequence diagram, between the target lifelines, right-click the gray bar, and then choose No Width Restrictions.<br>
        The IDE removes any existing restriction, and removes any displays restriction indicator from the gray bar.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="note">
      <li>To re-order Lifelines, simply drag a timeline to a new location.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
