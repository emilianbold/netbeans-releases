<title>Working With Association End Names (UML Modeling)</title>

<body>
<h2>Working with Association End Names</h2>
<p>The IDE lets you assign end names to the ends of an association. When you assign end names, they appear in the Properties window under the Ends node, and in the association's Class diagram. You can show and hide these end names in their Diagram window.</p>
<p><b>To show or hide association end names:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In the target association Diagram window, right-click the target end of the target association, select Labels and then choose Both End Names.<br>
The IDE displays or hides the end name, as applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To assign a new end name:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the target association Diagram window, double-click the target association end name.<br>
The end name becomes editable.</li>
<li>Type the new end name and click the diagram background.<br>
The IDE accepts the change, displaying the end name at the specified end of the association, as well as under the Association Ends node of the Properties window.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
<li>The IDE also lets you change an association's end names from the Properties window. Select an association to display its information in the editor, and then double-click an end name to edit it.</li>
</ul>
