<h2>UML Modeling Basics</h2>
<p>UML Modeling uses projects to organize the system modeling process. You create a model for a system by specifying UML diagrams, which you can organize within any number of projects. When you are ready to generate application code from a UML model, you associate the model's UML project with a Java project. The project is completely and automatically integrated into the IDE and its navigation features such as the Projects, Files, Runtime, and Navigator windows. You exercise the feature's functionality through its menus, toolbars, palettes, Diagram editor, Properties editor, Documentation window, keyboard commands, and source editor. </p>
<p>The following topics provide more information about the basics of UML Modeling in the IDE:</p>
