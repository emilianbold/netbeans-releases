<title>Moving Modeling Elements (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Moving Modeling Elements</h2>
<p>You can move UML Modeling elements in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between package nodes in the Projects window </li>
<li>From the Projects window to a diagram that is open in the Diagram editor </li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, you can drag the element onto its destination. Thus, the Projects window can act as a library of easily accessible, reusable objects.</p>
<h3>Moving Elements Within the Projects Window </h3>
<p>You can drag modeling elements (such as Classes, Packages, and Actors) and some other elements (such as attributes and operations) from one project to another project in the Projects window. You can also nest elements by moving an element under another element in the project tree.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>Not all elements can be nested; some restrictions apply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To move elements within the Projects window:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, select an element.</li>
<li>Drag the element onto a project node or another element node.<br>
UML Modeling relocates the element to its new location in the tree.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Dragging Elements From the Projects Window Onto Diagrams </h3>
<p>You can drag modeling elements  from the Projects window to a diagram that is open in the Diagram editor.</p>
<p><b>To move onto a diagram an element that is listed in the Projects window:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, select an element.</li>
<li>Drag the element onto the receiving diagram window.</li>
</ol>
