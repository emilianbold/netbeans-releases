<h2>Interfaces: Java Reverse Engineering</h2>
<p>Interfaces in the Java language provide some of the features of multiple inheritance without the drawbacks of full multiple inheritance. A class extends only a single superclass, but it can implement one or more interfaces. Interfaces themselves can extend other interfaces. </p>
<p>An interface is not a definition of a class, but a definition of a set of methods that one or more classes will implement. An important issue of interfaces is that they declare only methods and constants. Variables cannot be defined in interfaces.</p>
<p>The syntax of an interface is a subset of the syntax for a class. </p>
<p>During reverse engineering: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each interface declaration generates a class component.</li>
<li>Interfaces that inherit from other interfaces are linked to their super-interface's component using a generalization link.</li>
<li>A class's implementation of an interface results in a generalization link between the class's component and the interface's component.</li>
</ul>
