<h2>Working With Packages</h2>
<p>The IDE lets you do the following with any package:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="creating.html">Create packages</a></li>
<li><a href="renaming.html">Rename packages</a></li>
<li><a href="deleting.html">Delete packages</a></li>
<li><a href="changing_symbol_display.html">Change package element display</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can work with packages in these ways directly from the Projects window and from any diagram open in the Diagram editor. In the Projects window, you can also drag packages onto the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Actor in the Projects window </li>
<li>Any package in the Projects window</li>
<li>Any Class in the Projects window</li>
<li>Any diagram open in the Diagram editor </li>
</ul>
<p>When you drag a package onto an Actor or Class element, or onto another package listed in the Projects window, that package becomes a sub-node of the element in the Projects window.</p>
