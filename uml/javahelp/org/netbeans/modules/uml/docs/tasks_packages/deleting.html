<h2>Deleting Packages</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can delete a UML Modeling package <a href="#workspace_tab">from the Projects window</a> or <a href="#diagram_window">from the Diagram editor</a>. As you delete a package that contains any diagrams, the IDE asks you to confirm the deletion.</p>
<p><b><a name="workspace_tab"></a>To delete a package from the Projects window:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, navigate to the node for the package you want to delete.</li>
<li>Right-click the Package node and choose Delete.<br>
Two successive confirmation dialogs appear.</li>
<li>To continue with the deletion, click Yes in each confirmation dialog.
<p>The package is deleted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b><a name="diagram_window"></a>To delete a package from the Diagram editor:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Display the diagram in the Diagram editor.</li>
<li>In the Diagram editor, select the package and choose Edit &gt; Delete.<br>
A confirmation dialog appears.</li>
<li>If you want to delete all elements connected to the package, leave the checkbox selected.<br>
If you want to delete only the package but keep the elements it contains (elements connected to the package by nested links), deselect the checkbox.
<p> The package and, if appropriate, its contained elements are deleted. However, the diagram that contained the package remains, as do any elements that were not contained in the package.</p>
</li>
</ol>
