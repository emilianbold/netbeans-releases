<h2>Layout Properties Sheet: Hierarchical Tab</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Hierarchical tab of the Layout property sheet lets you specify options for any diagram that uses the Hierarchical layout. The table below describes these options.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

<th scope="col" align="left">Options</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="4">Orientation</td>
<td>Top to Bottom</td>
<td rowspan="4">The orientation of your diagram. Reorienting a diagram does not automatically change port specifications, connectors, element shapes, or constraints, which might rely on specific sides of elements. Think about the side effects before you reorient a complex diagram.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Left to Right</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Bottom to Top</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Right to Left</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="3">Level Alignment</td>
<td>Top</td>
<td rowspan="3">How subsite levels are aligned with regard to one another on each tree level.</td>

<td>Bottom</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="3">Layout Quality</td>
<td>Draft</td>
<td rowspan="3">The speed of the algorithm used to produce the layout. Draft represents the lowest quality, but fastest level of layout. Proof represents the highest quality, slowest level.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="2">Horizontal Spacing </td>
<td>Spacing Between Nodes </td>
<td>The space between diagram elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Spacing Between Edges </td>
<td>The space between parallel links. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="2">Vertical Spacing </td>
<td>Spacing Between Nodes </td>
<td>The space between diagram elements.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Spacing Between Edges </td>

<tr valign="top">
<td rowspan="3">Routing</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>The nature and look of the links in the target diagram.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Orthogonal</td>
<td>Enables orthogonal routing, which routes edges horizontally and vertically. You can adjust the spacing between parallel edge segments in an orthogonally routed layout. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Polyline</td>
<td>Enables polyline routing, which routes edges as one or more straight line segments with arbitrary angles. The algorithm keeps polyline-routed edges from overlapping nodes by adding path nodes as needed. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Orthogonal Routing </td>
<td>Fix Node Sizes </td>
<td>With orthogonal routing, you can choose to have fixed node sizes. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Polyline Routing </td>
<td>Spacing Between Bends </td>
<td>With polyline routing, you can specify the distance between bends. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td colspan="2">Variable Level Spacing</td>
<td>Whether or not to adjust the spacing between pairs or neighboring levels according to the density of links between the levels.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td colspan="2">Undirected Layout</td>
<td>Whether the layout is to be undirected, which means that the source and target elements of any link are treated the same. In a directed-layout diagram, the direction of the link is significant. Networks are often represented in undirected layouts, while processes are often represented in directed layouts.</td>
