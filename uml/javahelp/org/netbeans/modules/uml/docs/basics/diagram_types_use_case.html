<h2>About Use Case Diagrams</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A Use case diagram depicts a set of use cases and actors and their relationships. This kind of diagram addresses the static use case view of a system.</p>
<p>Use case diagrams describe the behavior of a system from a user's standpoint, are functional descriptions of a system and its major processes, provide a graphic description of who will use a system and what kinds of interactions to expect within that system, act as processes that occur within the UML Modeling context, and have entities outside the area that are going to use the application known as actors.</p>
<p>Use case driven is in the context of the software development life cycle, a process in which use cases are used as a primary artifact for establishing the desired behavior of the system, for verifying and validating the system's architecture, for testing, and for communicating among the stakeholders of the project.</p>
<p>A use case view is the view of the system's architecture that encompasses the use cases that describe the behavior of the system as seen by its end users, analyst, and testers.</p>
