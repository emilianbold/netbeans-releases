<h2>About Diagrams</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Diagrams are the way UML Modeling displays static structures in your system. When you create a diagram, it is displayed in the Projects window under the current project node. You can create as many diagrams in a project as you need. Each UML Modeling diagram consists of two distinctly different types of data, each saved as a different file with different file extensions. </p>
<p>UML Modeling lets you work with eight types of diagrams. The table below describes each type of diagram:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Type</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_activity.html">Activity Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of any system's activities and flows of data or decisions between activities. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_class.html">Class Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of any system's objects and the relationships between them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_collaboration.html">Collaboration Diagram</a></td>
<td>An interaction diagram that emphasizes the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages. This type of diagram shows interactions that are organized around instances and their links to each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_component.html">Component Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of the definitions of components, in terms of the externally visible interfaces exposed by its ports, and their internal structure consisting of classifiers used as its parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_deployment.html">Deployment Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of the definition of Nodes and Artifacts that are deployed on them. This type of diagram is based on a general static-structure diagram that has been extended with deployment elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_sequence.html">Sequence Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of the interaction between collaborating groups of objects in a system.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_state.html">State Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation of the state machines. It shows the behaviors that make up the sequence of states that an object goes through during its lifetime in response to events, together with its responses to those events.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="diagram_types_use_case.html">Use Case Diagram</a></td>
<td>A visual representation that shows a set of use cases and actors and their relationships. Use case diagrams address the static use case view of a system.</td>
</tr>
