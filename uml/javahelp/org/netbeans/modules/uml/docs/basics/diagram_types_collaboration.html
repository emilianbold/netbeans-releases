<h2>About Collaboration Diagrams</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A Collaboration Diagram is an interaction diagram that emphasizes the structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages; a diagram that shows interactions organized around instances and their links to each other. A collaboration diagram is a cross between a component diagram and sequence diagram in which it describes a specific scenario by numbered arrows showing the movement of messages during the course of a scenario.</p>
<p>Collaboration diagrams allow you to show a spatial organization of components and interactions rather than concentrating on the sequence of the interactions.</p>
