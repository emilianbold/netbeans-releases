<h2>Activity Diagram Elements</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The following table describes the elements that you can add to Activity diagrams. The elements are grouped by <a href="palette.html">Modeling Palette</a> section.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Element</th>

<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Basic Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Invocation</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/invocation-node.png"></td>
<td>The use of a behavior within an Activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Activity Edge</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/activity-edge.png"></td>
<td>An abstract class for directed connections between two Activity nodes.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Activity Group</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/complex-activity-group.png"></td>
<td>Sets of invocation nodes and activity edges in an Activity. A generic grouping construct for nodes and edges.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Initial Node</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/initial-node.png"></td>
<td>A control node at which flow starts when the Activity is invoked.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Activity Final Node</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/final-state.png"></td>
<td>The final node that stops all flows in an Activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Flow Final</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/flow-final-node.png"></td>
<td>The final node that terminates a flow and destroys all tokens that arrive at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Control Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Decision</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/pseudostate-choice.png"></td>
<td>A control node that chooses between outgoing flows.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Vertical Fork</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/fork-node.png"></td>
<td>A vertical control node that splits a flow into multiple concurrent flows.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Horizontal Fork</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/pseudostate-join-horizontal.png"></td>
<td>A horizontal control node that splits a flow into multiple concurrent flows.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Data Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Parameter Usage</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/parameter-usage-node.png"></td>
<td>An object node for inputs and outputs to invocations. Parameter usage nodes flow directly to or from invocations.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Data Store</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/datastore-node.png"></td>
<td>A central buffer node for non-transient information. Object node for mapping flows from multiple sources and destinations.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Signal</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/signal-node.png"></td>
<td>An object node that sends or receives signals. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Partition</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/partition.png"></td>
<td>A special kind of grouping of invocations and activity edges. Partitions divide the nodes and edges to constrain and show a view of the contained nodes. Partitions often correspond to organizational units in a business model.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Dependencies Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Dependency</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/dependency.png"></td>
<td>The relationship between two elements whose definitions depend on one another in such a way that changes to one can result in changes to the other. For example, when one class mentions another as an operation parameter, or as part of its data, the two classes exhibit dependency.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Realize</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/realize.png"></td>
<td>A semantic relationship between classifier. One classifier specifies a contract that another classifier guarantees to carry out. These relationships are used in two places: between interfaces and the classes that realize them, and between Use Cases and the Collaborations that realize them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Usage</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/usage.png"></td>
<td>A dependency in which one element (the client) requires the presence of another element (the supplier) for its correct functioning or implementation. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Permission</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/permission.png"></td>
<td>A dependency that signifies granting of access rights from the supplier model element to a client model element, in which the client requires access to some or all of the constituent elements of the supplier.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Abstraction</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/abstraction.png"></td>
<td>A boundary relative to the perspective of the viewer. The essential characteristics of an entity that distinguish it from all other kinds of entities. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Comments Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/notepad.png"></td>
<td>A Notepad notation. Use Comments to record information for a element or link in a diagram. This information is not included in generated code but is for information only. Each Comment can contain unlimited text, and can be numbered. You can also define a stereotype, and enter a noted element.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Link Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/note-link.png"></td>
<td>The connection between the comment element and the associated element.</td>
</tr>
