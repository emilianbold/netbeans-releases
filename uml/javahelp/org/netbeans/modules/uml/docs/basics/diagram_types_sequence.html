<h2>About Sequence Diagrams</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A Sequence diagram depicts the interaction between collaborating groups of objects in a system. These diagrams consist of vertical lines called lifelines, each of which represents the life of a given object. Lifelines are connected by horizontal lines denoting messages passed from one object to the next in the use case. You can also assign self-referential messages to lifelines. </p>
<p>When you click the Diagram window of a Sequence diagram, the IDE displays a specific selection of icons in the Modeling Palette. These icons are not displayed when you click a Diagram window displaying a Class diagram. When you delete a Sequence diagram operation, the IDE deletes all corresponding messages with that name and matching parameters. Naming a message in the Sequence diagram checks the target class' operations for existence and possible addition of the new message to the list of operations.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>Unlike Diagram windows displaying Class diagrams, those displaying Sequence diagrams offer a gray lifeline track. Located at the top of each Sequence diagram window, this track displays icons representing each component in the diagram, and lets you move the components around so that you can view the names of lifelines and space components for message placement.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>To re-order Lifelines, simply drag a timeline to a new location.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, a Sequence diagram depicts a single use case in a system, but new UML 2.0 functionality greatly expands upon the basics of Sequence diagram use and functionality. The specifications for UML 2.0 offer the following functionality:</p>
