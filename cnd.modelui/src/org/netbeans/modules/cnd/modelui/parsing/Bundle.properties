Dialog_Title=Resolve Parsing Problem
Dialog_Action=details
Dialog_Short_Title=Lack of Memory

Explanation=While parsing project IDE detects a lack of avaliable memory. Lack of memory results in slowdown parsing.<br>\
To resolve problem you can provide Java more heap size by option "-J-Xmx&lt;size&gt;". \
For example option: <pre>-J-Xmx1000m</pre> specifies 1000 megabytes of heap size. \
You can write this option in the configure file ${NB}/etc/netbeans.conf in the property netbeans_default_options.<br>\
Advice: if you use 64-bit version of JVM you can reduce memory consumption by using 32-bit version of JVM.
