OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Supports Java ME CDC Projects, such as for mobile client-side Java.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Support for Java ME CDC Projects. \
    A CDC project can compile a Java source root, build a JAR from it, \
    run JUnit-based tests, create Javadoc, and run or debug an application \
    with a main class.

# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: COMMENT_* keys are used to create the initial project.properties
# for a project. The properties file format only accepts ISO-8859-1 characters in their
# raw form, i.e. Western European scripts. Any other characters (e.g. Asian) will be stored
# in the properties file correctly but be unreadable in text mode: \u1234 syntax is used.
# (The proper characters will be displayed only if the file is opened in the table editor.)
