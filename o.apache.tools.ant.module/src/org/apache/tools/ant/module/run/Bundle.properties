EXC_non_local_proj_file=You may only execute Ant scripts residing on disk.

# AntCompilerType
# {0} - compiler type display name
# {1} - data object node display name
EXC_ant_compiler_on_non_ant_script=\
        You may not use the compiler {0} on the object {1} because it is not an Ant script.\n\
        Perhaps you meant to use Indirect Ant Compilation instead (refer to documentation).

# IndirectAntCompilerType
EXC_indirect_compiler_on_script=\
        You are attempting to use an indirect Ant compiler {0} on the Ant script {1}.\n\
        Please use direct Ant Script Compilation instead (refer to documentation).
# {0} - display name of build script
EXC_must_be_local=Object {0} must reside on local disk.
# {0} - display name of build script
EXC_build_xml_not_found=No build.xml Ant script was found above object {0}.
# {0} - node display name
# {1} - display name of compiler type
EXC_build_xml_not_found2=The object {0} is configured to use {1} but the build script can no longer be found.
# {0} - directory path
EXC_dir_not_readable=Directory {0} is not readable.

EXC_not_an_ant_script=\
        You cannot use {2} on {0} because it is an object of type {1}. \
        Ant executors may only be used on Ant build scripts. \
        Please see the online help for further explanation.
