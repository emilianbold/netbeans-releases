<h2>Implementing the  javax.management.NotificationEmitter
Interface<br>
</h2>
<br>
NotificationEmitter is implemented using a contextual action (enabled only if an<span style="font-weight: bold;">
MBean</span> is selected) located under the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Management</span> menu.
You can access the management menu from :<br>
<ul>
  <li>The contextual menu for the project tree node (right click on selected node)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Applicability of the Action</h2>
<br>
This action&nbsp; applies to any MBean type. If an MBean already
implements this interface, the action is disabled.<br>
This action applies to any MBean. You don't need to have generated them
using the MBean wizard. <br>
MBeans imported from other contexts can be updated.<br>

menu select <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Implement
NotificationEmitter Interface...</span></li>
  <li>The wizard can generate an implementation of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">NotificationEmitter</span> interface based

NotificationBroadcasterSupport delegation. Some code to handle the
notification sequence number can also be generated. Check the
associated checkboxes to have this code generated.</li>
