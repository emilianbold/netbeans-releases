<h2>Instrumentation Level</h2>
<p>This tier contains MBeans and their manageable resources. It
provides a specification for implementing JMX technology-manageable
resources, which can be an application, service, device, or user. A
resource is manageable if it is developed in Java (or provides a Java
wrapper) and has been instrumented so that it can be managed by
JMX-compliant applications. A resource is instrumented by one or more
MBeans that are either standard or dynamic. Standard MBeans are Java
objects that conform to certain design patterns (for example, they must
have a constructor and setter/getter methods). A dynamic MBean conforms
to a specific interface that offers more flexibility at runtime. The
instrumentation of a resource allows it to be manageable at the agent
level; however, note that MBeans do not require knowledge of the JMX
agent with which they operate. In other words, any JMX-manageable
resource can use any JMX agent that offers the services it requires.
</p>
<p>
The key Components at the instrumentation level are the MBeans, the
notification model, and the MBean metadata classes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MBeans</b>: An MBean is a Java object that implements a
specific interface. The management interface of an MBean is represented
as: (1) valued attributes that can be accessed; (2) operations that can
be invoked; (3) notifications that can be emitted; and (4) the
constructors. There are four types of MBeans:</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Standard MBeans</b>: The simplest to design and implement.
Their management interface is described by their method names.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic MBeans</b>: They implement a specific interface, and
they expose their management interfaces at runtime for greatest
flexibility.</li>
    <li><b>Open MBean</b>: Dynamic MBeans that rely on basic data types
for universal manageability; they are self-describing for
user-friendliness.</li>
    <li><b>Model MBeans</b>: Dynamic MBeans that are fully configurable
and self described at runtime. They provide a generic MBean class with
default behavior for dynamic instrumentation of resources. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Notification Model</b>: JMX technology defines a generic
notification model based on the Java event model. It lets developers
build proactive management solutions. Using notifications, JMX agents
and MBeans can send critical information to interested parties such as
management applications or other MBeans.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li><b>MBean Metadata Classes</b>: These classes contain the
structures to describe all components of an MBean's management
interface: its attributes, operations, notification, and constructors.
For each of these, the metadata include a name, a description and its
particular characteristics (for example, an attribute is readable,
writeable, or both; for an operation, the signature of its parameter
and return types).<small></small></li>
