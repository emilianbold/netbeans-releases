<h2>About JMX Application Development</h2>
<blockquote>
The Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Management Extensions (JMX<sup><font
 size="-2">TM</font></sup>) API is a standard API introduced in J2SE
5.0 for management and monitoring of resources such as applications,
devices, services, and the Java virtual machine. The JMX technology was
developed through the Java Community Process (JCP) as Java
Specification Request (JSR) 3, Java Management Extensions, and JSR 160,
JMX Remote API.
  <p>Typical uses of the JMX technology include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consulting and changing application configuration</li>
    <li>Accumulating statistics about application behavior and making
them available</li>
    <li>Notifying of state changes and erroneous conditions. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The JMX API includes remote access, so a remote management program
can interact with a running application for these purposes.</p>
