        <h2>Using the SOAP Web Service Designer</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        
        <p>The Web Service Designer is the primary workspace within which
        SOAP web service design takes place in the IDE. It unifies the two
        ways in which you can develop web services&#8212;from Java classes and
        from WSDL files. Tabs are provided for switching from the source view
        to the design view. The Web Service Designer enables
        you to lay out web services by visually adding operations and enabling
        features such as reliable message delivery. In particular, you can do
        the following in the design view:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Add web service operations
            <li>Delete web service operations
            <li>Change web service operation name
            <li>Optimize binary data transfer (MTOM)
            <li>Set up the reliable messaging delivery
            <li>Set up the web service security
            <li>View what the SOAP requests and responses will look like on the wire
        </ul>    
        
        <p>To open the Web Service Designer, create
        a SOAP web service, expand the Web Services
        node in the Projects window, and double-click
        on the node representing the web service.
