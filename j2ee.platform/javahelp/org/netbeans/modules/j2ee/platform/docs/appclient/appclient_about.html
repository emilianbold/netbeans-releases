    <h2>About Enterprise Application Clients</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>A Java EE application client is a stand-alone application that is configured
    to work as part of a Java EE enterprise application. Any Java application can access 
    remote EJB methods and web services, so you do not necessarily have 
    to create a Java EE application client to access your enterprise application. The advantage of accessing enterprise applications
    from enterprise application clients is that application clients have access to services and functionality running on the 
    enterprise application server, while regular Java applications do not. For example, you can configure security roles and 
    permissions for an enterprise application client.</p>
    <p>An application client is configured using deployment descriptors and is added to an enterprise application 
    as a module. </p>
    <p>In the IDE, you can create an application client project and import an existing
    application client into an IDE project. You can create an application client as part of a new
    enterprise application or create a single application client and add it to any existing
    enterprise application.</p>
