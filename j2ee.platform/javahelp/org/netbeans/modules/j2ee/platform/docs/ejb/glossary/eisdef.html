<h6>enterprise information system</h6>
<p> Enterprise information system (EIS) software includes enterprise infrastructure 
  systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), mainframe transaction processing, 
  database systems, and other legacy information systems that are not part of 
  Java EE. The EIS tier, one of several tiers of the Java EE multitiered distributed
  application model, handles EIS software, which runs on an EIS server that is 
  external to the Java EE application server. Java EE application components use the
  Java EE Connector architecture to access EIS tier resources.</p>
