<h2>About Message-Driven Beans</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A message-driven bean is an enterprise bean that enables J2EE applications 
  to process messages asynchronously. The bean acts as a Java Message Service 
  (JMS) message listener, which is similar to an event listener except that the 
  message-driven bean receives messages instead of events. The messages can be 
  sent by any J2EE component: an application client, another enterprise 
  bean, or a web component. </p>
<h3>Why Use Message-Driven Beans?</h3>
<p>You might use message-driven beans instead of session beans or entity beans if you 
  want to avoid tying up server resources. Session beans and entity beans also 
  enable you to send and receive JMS messages, but they operate synchronously, 
  not asynchronously, as do message-driven beans.</p>
<h3>Comparison to Session Beans and Entity Beans</h3>
<p>Unlike session beans and entity beans, clients of message-driven beans do not access 
  them through interfaces. A message-driven bean has only a bean class. </p>
<p>In several respects, a message-driven bean resembles a stateless session bean: 
</p>
<ul>
  
<li>A message-driven bean's instances typically retain no data or conversational 
    state for a specific client. </li>
<li>All instances of a message-driven bean are equivalent, enabling the EJB 
    container to assign a message to any message-driven bean instance. The container 
    can pool these instances to enable streams of messages to be processed concurrently. 
  </li>
<li>A single message-driven bean can process messages from multiple clients. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The instance variables of the message-driven bean instance can maintain some 
  state information across the handling of client messages, such as an object 
  reference to an enterprise bean object.</p>
<h3>Message Handling</h3>
<p>When a message arrives, the container calls the message-driven bean's <tt>onMessage</tt> 
  method to process the message. The <tt>onMessage</tt> method normally casts the message 
  to one of the five JMS message types and handles the message in accordance with the application's 
  business logic. The <tt>onMessage</tt> method might call helper methods, or it might 
  invoke a session bean or an entity bean to process the information in the message and possibly store the results  in a database. </p>
<p>Many instances of a message-driven bean class can execute concurrently, enabling 
  a stream of messages to be processed concurrently. Because there are no guarantees 
  of the exact order in which messages are delivered to these instances, message-driven 
  beans must be prepared to handle messages that are out of sequence. For example, 
  the message to cancel a reservation might be delivered before the message to 
  make the reservation.</p>
<h3>Transactions</h3>
<p> The container provides the message-driven bean instance with a <tt>MessageDrivenContext</tt>, 
  which gives the bean instance access to the context maintained for it by the 
  container. Depending on whether the bean manages its own transactions or relies on the container's transaction management, the bean can access different 
  methods of <tt>MessageDrivenContext</tt> to handle transactions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Bean-managed transactions.</b> The bean sets up its own transactions. 
    The bean instance can call the <tt>MessageDrivenContext</tt> method <tt>getUserTransaction</tt> 
    to get the <tt>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</tt> interface. The bean 
    instance can then use the interface to demarcate transactions and obtain transaction 
    status. 
    <p> If the bean uses this<tt></tt> interface to demarcate transactions, the 
      message receipt that causes the bean to be invoked is not part of the transaction. 
      If you want the message receipt to be part of the transaction, you must 
      use container-managed transactions. </p>
    <p>A message-driven bean's <tt>newInstance</tt>, <tt>setMessageDrivenContext</tt>, 
      <tt>ejbCreate</tt>, and <tt>ejbRemove</tt> methods are called with an unspecified 
      transaction context. There is never a client transaction context available 
      when a message-driven bean is invoked because a transaction context does 
      not flow with a JMS message.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Container-managed transactions.</b> The bean uses transactions started 
    by the EJB container. The <tt>onMessage</tt> method is invoked in the scope 
    of a transaction determined by the transaction property specified in the bean's 
    deployment descriptor editor. If the bean is using container-managed transactions, 
    the IDE specifies <tt>Required</tt> for the transaction property. 
    <p>The bean can use the following <tt>MessageDrivenContext</tt> methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <tt>setRollbackOnly</tt> method enables the instance to mark the 
        current transaction and force the outcome of the transaction to be a rollback.</li>
      <li>The <tt>getRollbackOnly</tt> method enables the instance to test if 
        the current transaction has been marked for rollback.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
