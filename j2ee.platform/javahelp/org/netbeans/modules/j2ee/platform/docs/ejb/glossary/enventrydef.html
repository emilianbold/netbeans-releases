<h6>environment entry</h6>
<p>An element of a deployment descriptor that defines a value for an enterprise 
  bean. The value declared for an environment entry takes effect in a particular 
  deployment environment. By defining environment entries, you can specify different 
  behaviors for different deployment environments, such as the name of a JDBC 
  driver and the name of a JDBC data source that differ depending on where a J2EE 
  application is deployed. You can override the value specified for an environment 
  entry at the EJB module level and the J2EE application level.</p>
<p>An environment entry is not an operating system environment variable. An environment 
  entry exists in a deployment descriptor and possibly in the application server 
  to which a J2EE application is deployed.</p>
