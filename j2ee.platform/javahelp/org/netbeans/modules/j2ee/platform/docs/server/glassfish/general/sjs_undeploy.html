    <h2>Undeploying an Application or Module from the GlassFish Application Server</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>When the GlassFish application server is running, you can undeploy, enable, and disable an application
    or module in the Services window of the IDE.
    By default, applications and modules are automatically registered, deployed and made available on the
    server when you run a project, and are automatically redeployed when they have been modified in the IDE.</p>    
    <p>Deployed applications are visible in the Services window under the server instance node under
    the Applications node. Deployed EJB Modules are visible in the EJB Modules node.
    When you undeploy an application or module, the archive file (<tt>ear</tt>, <tt>war</tt>, <tt>jar</tt>) 
    is removed from the server and is no longer visible in the Services window.</p>
    <p><b>To undeploy an application or module:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure the GlassFish application server is running.</li>
        <li>In the Services window, expand the server instance's Applications node.</li>
        <li>Right-click the application or module and choose Undeploy.</li>
    </ol>
