        <h2>Setting a Proxy for Web Services and Clients</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>

        <p>If you want to access a remote web service, but your system is 
        behind a firewall or you use a proxy server, you need to configure the IDE with your proxy settings.
        For working with remote web services, setting a proxy can be important in one or more of the following areas:

        <ul>
            <li>When retrieving the WSDL file in the Web Service Client wizard.
            <li>When using the IDE to test the web service.
            <li>When deploying to the Sun Java System Application Server.
            <li>When deploying to the JBoss Server.
            <li>When deploying to the Tomcat Web Server.
            <li>When deploying a web service client in a Java application.
        </ul>

        <p>The proxy settings for each of the situations above are described below.

        <p><b>To retrieve the WSDL file in the Web Service Client wizard:</b>
        <p>Typically, an error such as the following is displayed in the Web Service Client wizard when the proxy settings
        for retrieving a WSDL file have
        not been set correctly:
        <p><tt>Download failed. I/O exception: (Check the proxy settings.)</tt>
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>Click Proxy Settings in the Web Service Client wizard.
        <li>In the HTTP Proxy Settings window, set the proxy host and port number.</ol>
        <p>The changes take effect when you click OK.


        <p><b>To use the IDE to test the web service:</b>
        <p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
        for testing a web service from the IDE have
        not been set correctly:
        <p><tt>org.netbeans.modules.websvc.registry.ui.ReflectionHelper.callMethodWithParams(ReflectionHelper.java:449)</tt>
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options.
        <li>In the Options window, set the proxy host and port number.</ol>
        <p>The changes take effect when you exit the Options window.

        <p><b>To deploy to the Sun Java System Application Server:</b>
        <p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
        for a web service or web service client deployed to the Sun Java System Application Server have
        not been set correctly:
        <p><tt>java.rmi.RemoteException: HTTP transport error: java.net.UnknownHostException:</tt>
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>Open the Services window (Ctrl-5).
        <li>If the Sun Java System
        Application Server is not started, start it.
        <li>Expand Sun Java System
        Application Server's node, right-click the JVM's node, and choose Properties.
        <li>In the JVM's Properties dialog box, click JVMOptions.
        <li>Add the following properties:
        <p><tt>-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</i></tt>
        <br><tt>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port.number</i></tt></ol>
        <p>Stop and then restart the server for the new proxy settings to take effect.

        <p><b>To deploy to the JBoss Server:</b>
        <p>Typically, <i>nothing</i> is displayed in the browser when the proxy settings
        for a web service or web service client deployed to JBoss have
        not been set correctly.
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>In your filesystem, go to <tt><i>jboss_install_dir\</i>bin\run.bat</tt>.
        <li>Add this line:
        <tt>set JAVA_OPTS=-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</i> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port.number</i></tt></ol>
        <p>Stop and then restart the server for the new proxy settings to take effect.


        <p><b>To deploy to the Tomcat Web Server:</b>
        <p>Typically, <i>nothing</i> is displayed in the browser when the proxy settings
        for a web service or web service client deployed to JBoss have
        not been set correctly.
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>Open the Services window (Ctrl-5).
        <li>If the Tomcat Web Server is started, stop it.
        <li>Right-click the Tomcat node and choose Properties.
        <li>In the Platform tab, add the following properties in the VM Options text box:
        <p><tt>-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</i></tt>
        <br><tt>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port</i></tt></ol>
        <p>Start the server for the new proxy settings to take effect.
  
        <p><b>To deploy a web service client in a Java application:</b>

        <p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
        for a web service or web service client deployed from a Java application have
        not been set correctly:
        <p><tt>java.rmi.RemoteException: HTTP transport error: java.net.UnknownHostException:</tt>
        <p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
        <ol>
        <li>Right-click the Java application project node in the Projects window
        and choose Properties.
        <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, click Run.
        <li>Add the following properties to the VM Options field:
        <p><tt>-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</i></tt> <tt>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port</i></tt></ol>

        <p>The changes take effect when you click OK.
        <p>Note that for client deployment from Java applications, you must set the proxy for each project, because
        each Java application runs as a stand-alone JVM process and each can provide different JVM parameters. For web
        applications sharing the same instance of a server, you need set the proxy only once --
        on the server itself, as described above.
