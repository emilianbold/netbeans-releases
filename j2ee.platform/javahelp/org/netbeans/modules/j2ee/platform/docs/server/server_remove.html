<h2>Removing an Application from a Server</h2>
<p><small> 
    <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
<p>When you no longer need to run an application that was added to the server using 
  the IDE, you can remove the application's context from the server in the Services window. </p>
  <p>By default, applications and modules are automatically registered, deployed and made available on the
    server when you run a project, and are automatically redeployed when they have been modified in the IDE.
    Once deployed, applications remain on the server until they are removed. </p>
    <p>Deployed applications are visible in the Services window in the server instance node under
    Enterprise Applications or Web Applications.
    When you undeploy an application, the archive file (<tt>ear</tt>, <tt>war</tt>, <tt>jar</tt>) 
    is removed from the server and is no longer visible in the Services window.</p>
<p><b>To remove an application from a server:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the Services window by choosing Window &gt; Services (Ctrl-5) from the main menu.</li>
    <li>Expand the Servers node and ensure the server is running.
    <ul class="note"><li>If the server is not running, start the server by right-clicking the server node in the Services window 
        and choosing Start. Alternately, click the Start Server button (&nbsp;<img src="../images/start.png">&nbsp;) in the server tab in the Output window.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Expand the node of the server instance. If the server is not running, no subnodes are visible.</li>
    <li>Expand the node containing the application you want to remove.</li>
    <li>Right-click the application's context node and choose Undeploy.</li>
</ol>
