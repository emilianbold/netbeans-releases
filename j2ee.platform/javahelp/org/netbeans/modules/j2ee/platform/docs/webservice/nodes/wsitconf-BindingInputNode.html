        <p>In the WSIT tab's Operation section, on the service side, 
        you can add WSIT security to a specific web service operation. Security mechanism 
        at this level is used to specify what is
        being protected and the level of protection required.
        
        <p>In this section, you can specify parts of a message that require integrity protection
        (digital signature) and/or confidentiality (encryption). When you do this, the
        specified part of the message, outside of security headers, requires signature and/
        or encryption. For example, a message producer might submit an order that contains
        an orderID header. The producer signs and/or encrypts the orderID header (the
        SOAP message header) and the body of the request (the SOAP message body).
        Parts that can be signed and/or encrypted include the body, the header, the local
        name of the SOAP header, and the namespace of the SOAP header.
        
        <p>You can also specify arbitrary elements in the message that require integrity protection
        and/or confidentiality. Because of the mutability of some SOAP headers,
        a message producer may decide not to sign and/or encrypt the SOAP message
        header or body as a whole, but instead sign and/or encrypt elements within the
        header and body. Elements that can be signed and/or encrypted include an XPath
        expression or a URI which indicates the version of XPath to use.
        
        <p>In the Input Messgae section of the WSIT configuration editor, you can select the following
        options for securing an input message:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Authentication Token.</b> Select a supporting token that will be used to
            sign and/or encrypt the specified message parts. Options include Username,
            X509, SAML, Issued, or None.
            <li><b>Signed.</b> Specifies that the authentication token must be a signed, supporting
            token. A signed supporting token is also signed by the primary
            message signature.
            <li><b>Endorsing.</b> Specifies that the authentication token must be endorsed.
            With an endorsing supporting token, the key represented by the token is
            used to endorse/sign the primary message signature.            
        </ul>

        <p>Click Message Parts to specify which parts of the message
        need to be encrypted, signed, and/or required.
