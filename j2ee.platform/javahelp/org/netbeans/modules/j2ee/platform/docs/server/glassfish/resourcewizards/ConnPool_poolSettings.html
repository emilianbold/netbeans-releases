        <h2>New JDBC Connection Pool: Add Connection Pool Optional Settings</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This page of the New File wizard for defining a JDBC connection pool
        allows you to modify the default values for 
        pool settings, transaction isolation, and connection validation. It is best to 
        leave these settings at their default values and modify them later
        in the connection pool properties window.</p>
        <p>The following settings can be modified in this screen:</p> 
        
        <h3>Pool Settings</h3>
        <p>A set of physical database connections reside in the pool. 
        When an application requests a connection, the connection is 
        removed from the pool, and when the application releases the 
        connection, it is returned to the pool.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Steady Pool Size.</b> An integer value representing the number of
            connections in the pool at any given moment. Usually, this is the
            minimum connections in the pool.</li>
            <li><b>Max Pool Size.</b> An integer value representing the maximum number
            of connections in the pool.</li>
            <li><b>Max Wait time.</b> An integer value representing the maximum wait
            time in milliseconds.</li>
            <li><b>Pool Resize Quantity.</b> Connection pools, as they shrink to the
            minimum pool size, are resized in batches. This number represents the
            number of connections in the batch for resizing the pool. A batch size
            that is too large may delay connection recycling, while a batch size
            too small may be less efficient.</li>
            <li><b>Idle Timeout (seconds).</b> An integer value representing the maximum
            idle timeout length in seconds. This is the amount of time that a
            connection may remain idle in the pool. Connections that remain idle
            for longer than this time are closed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Transaction Isolation</h3>
        <p>Because a database is usually accessed by many users 
        concurrently, one transaction might update data while another 
        attempts to read the same data. The isolation level of a 
        transaction defines the degree to which the data being updated 
        is visible to other transactions. For details on isolation levels, 
        refer to the documentation of the database vendor.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Transaction Isolation.</b> Select one of the following 
            from the dropdown list: JDBC Driver Default, read-uncommitted, read-committed, 
            repeatable-read, serializable.</li>
            <li><b>Guarantee Isolation Level.</b> Set to true or false.
            If you set to true, all connections taken from the pool have 
            the same isolation level. For example, if the isolation level 
            for the connection is changed programatically 
            (with con.setTransactionIsolation) when last used, 
            this mechanism changes the status back to the specified 
            isolation level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connection Validation</h3>
        <p>The application server can validate connections before 
        they are passed to applications. Validation allows the application 
        server to automatically re-establish database connections if the 
        database becomes unavailable due to network failure or database 
        server crash. Validation of connections incurs additional 
        overhead and slightly reduces performance.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Connection Validation Required.</b> Set to true or false. When set to
            true, the application server validates connections before they are sent
            to an application. When validation is in force, the application
            server can automatically reinstate connections to databases that fail
            due to network or database server failures.</li>
            <li><b>Validation Method.</b> Select the validation method from the
                pull-down list. There are three valid methods: auto-commit, meta-data,
                and table.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>auto-commit</b> and <b>meta-data.</b> The application server validates a
                    connection by calling the con.getAutoCommit() and con.getMetaData()
                    methods. However, since the results of
                    these calls may be cached, they do not always provide reliable
                    validations.</li>
                    <li><b>table</b> The application queries a database table you&#8217;ve
                    specified, using the query: select (count *) from &lt;table-name&gt;.
                    While the table must exist and be accessible, it need not have any rows. Do not
                    use an existing table that has a large number of rows or
                    a table that is already frequently accessed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Table Name.</b> This is the name of the connection validation table. Set the table
            name if you selected table as the validation method.</li>
            <li><b>Fail All Connections.</b> Set to true or false. When set to
            true, if a single connection fails, the application server closes all
            connections in the pool and then reestablishes them. When set to
            false, only individual connections are reestablished.</li>
            <li><b>Non Transactional Connections.</b> Set to true or false.
            When set to true, connections are not automatically enlisted and delisted in transaction contexts.
            A non-transactional connection can be used to query the database while a transaction is still in progress (before the transaction commits). 
            Non-transactional connections are not automatically returned to the pool and need to be explicitly closed by the application.
            The default is false.</li>
            <li><b>Allow Non Component Callers.</b> Set to true or false. 
            When set to true, the connection pool can be accessed remotely by non-Java-EE components (components other than EJBs and servlets). 
            The returned connection is automatically enlisted with the transaction context obtained from the transaction manager.
            The default is false.</li>
        </ul>
