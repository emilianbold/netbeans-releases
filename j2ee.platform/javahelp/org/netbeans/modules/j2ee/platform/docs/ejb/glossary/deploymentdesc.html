<h6>deployment descriptor</h6>
<p>An XML-based text file whose elements describe how to assemble and deploy a 
  module to a specific environment. The elements also contain behavioral information 
  about components not included directly in code. The&nbsp;IDE generates a deployment 
  descriptor from the properties of an enterprise bean, an EJB module, or a J2EE application.</p>
<p>There are different types of deployment descriptors: EJB deployment descriptors 
  described in the Enterprise JavaBeans specification, web deployment descriptors 
  described in the Servlet specification, and application and application client 
  deployment descriptors described in the J2EE specification. </p>
<p>Deployment descriptors specify two kinds of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structural information describes the different components of the JAR (or 
    EAR) file, their relationship with each other, and their external dependencies. 
    Environment entries and resource requirements are part of the structural information. 
  </li>
  <li>Assembly information describes how contents of a JAR (or EAR) file can be 
    composed into a deployable unit.</li>
</ul>
