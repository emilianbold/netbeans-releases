<h2>Generating a RESTful Web Service from Scratch</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>

<p>Some JAX-WS web services can be described as being RESTful. 
REpresentational State Transfer (REST) REST is an architectural style. 
Elements of the REST archictectural style are its stateless client-server
architecture and the fact that web services are viewed as resources that 
can be identified by their URLs. The application of some or all of the 
constraints specified by the REST architectural style to a JAX-WS web 
service makes it a RESTful web service.

   <p>For a full tutorial on RESTful web services in the IDE,

        <p><b>To generate a RESTful web service from scratch:</b>        
        
<ol>
<li>Use the Plugin Manager under the Tools menu
    to install the following modules:
    <ul>
        <li>RESTful Web Service Libraries</li>
        <li>RESTful Web Service Support</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Create a web application project.
<li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the web application project node
and choose New. Then choose one of the following:

<ul>
    <li><b>RESTful Web Services from Entity Classes.</b> Creates RESTful web services from a set of entity classes.</li>
    <li><b>RESTful Web Services from Patterns.</b>
      Creates generic RESTful web services, stand-alone web services,
      or web services that are part of the Container pattern.</li>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Singleton.</b> Creates a singleton RESTful resource
          class with GET and PUT methods, using Java API for RESTful 
          Web Service (JSR-311). This pattern is useful for creating 
          a simple HelloWorld service and wrapper services for invoking 
          WSDL-based web services.
          <li><b>Container-Item.</b> Creates a pair of RESTful resource
          classes, consisting of an item resource class and its container
          resource class using Java API for RESTful Web Service (JSR-311). 
          Item resources can be created and added to the container resource
          using the POST method on the container resource class. Note 
          that the URI for the newly created item resource is determined
          by the container resource.
          <li><b>Client-Controlled Container-Item.</b> Creates a pair of RESTful
          resource classes, consisting of an item resource class and its container
          resource class using Java API for RESTful Web Service (JSR-311).
          This pattern is a slight variation of the Container-Item pattern.
          The difference is that there is no POST method on the container
          resource class for creating item resources. Instead, item resources 
          are created using the PUT method on the item resource class. 
          The reason this is called Client-Controlled Container-Item pattern
          is because the URI for the item resource is determined by the client
          and not the container resource. 
      </ul>
</ul>    
<p>Alternatively, you can choose the above templates
 by right-clicking the project node, choosing New &gt; Other
 and then selecting them from the Web Services category.
    
</li>
<li>Click Next and complete the wizard.
