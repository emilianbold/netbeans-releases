        <h2>Exposing the Web Service Client in the Projects Window</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>When you use the Web Service Client wizard, the IDE creates files such
        as stubs and other artifacts. These files are regenerated whenever you run the Build Project command.
        Therefore, like all other files that are regenerated during builds, these files are not shown in the Projects window. If you want to see
        the client files generated by the IDE, you must open the Files window (Ctrl-2) and
        look in the <tt>build</tt> folder until you find the client package that you
        defined in the Web Service Client wizard. 
 
        <p>You may need to examine the generated client files
        on a regular basis. It can be tedious to switch between the Projects window and Files window
        and to expand nodes in the Files window while looking for the client files. Therefore,
        you can manually add the package that you created in the Web Service Client wizard to the Projects window.
        This gives the generated client files greater visibility and lets you work with them more easily.

        <p><b>To expose the web service client artifacts in the Projects Window:</b>
	
        <ol>
            <li><a href="wsc_create.html">Create the web service client</a>
            <li>Right-click the project node and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
            <li>In the upper part of the Sources panel, click Add Folder and browse to the package containing the client files.
            <p>The client package is now displayed in the Source Package Folders list.
            <li>Click OK.
        </ol>

        <p>Now that you have added the client package as a source package folder, the
        following IDE functionality is available:
        <ul>
            <li>Code completion in a Java source file or JSP file find the classes
            in the client package.
            <li>Go to class (Ctrl-Shift-O) in a Java source file or JSP file finds
            the classes in the client package.
            <li>Hyperlinking. Hold down the Ctrl key and move the mouse over
            an identifier. A link appears. Click on it and the IDE opens the source.
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Do not add Java classes, or any other file, to the package that you added
            to the Projects window.	Do not modify any of the files that you find
            in this package. The reason for this is that when you run the Clean Project command, the package and
            its contents will be cleaned and you will lose the new and changed
            files you added to the package.</li>
        </ul>
