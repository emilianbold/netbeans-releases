<h2>About Enterprise Applications</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>An enterprise application is a collection of EJB modules and web application modules that 
      are configured to work together when deployed to a Java EE application server. The 
      enterprise application contains information about how the modules work with 
      each other.</p>
<p>The enterprise application also contains information about how the modules 
  work with the application server to which the enterprise application is deployed. 
  For example, if any entity beans use container-managed persistence, the enterprise 
  application tells the application server what transaction services are 
  needed. </p>
<p>An enterprise application has no source files of its own. It only contains 
  deployment descriptors and other configuration files. At compile time, the archive files (JAR 
  files and WAR files) for each of the enterprise application's modules are built and assembled 
  into one Enterprise Archive (EAR) file. This file is deployed to the application 
  server.</p>
