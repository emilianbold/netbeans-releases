<h6>security role reference</h6>
<p>If an enterprise bean uses security roles in its own methods to determine who 
  has authority to perform  tasks (also called <i>programmatic security</i>), 
  the bean has to have a security role reference defined for each role it uses. 
  A security role reference maps the bean's internal names for security roles 
  to roles that exist in the deployment environment. </p>
<p>A security role reference is required, for example, if the enterprise bean 
  makes calls to <tt>context.isCallerInRole(</tt><i>rolename</i><tt>)</tt> to get a 
  security role. </p>

<td> You can define security roles in an EJB module and in a J2EE application. 
      You can link these module-level and application-level security roles to 
      security role references in the included enterprise beans. You can also 
      map these security roles to users and groups that exist in a deployment 
      environment, creating a complete chain from the security role reference 
      in the enterprise bean to the deployment environment's users.</td>
