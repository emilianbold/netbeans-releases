<h2>New Session Bean Wizard</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>This wizard creates a new <a href="../general/about_session_beans.html">session 
  bean</a> in an EJB module project. You open the wizard by right-clicking the 
  project node or Enterprise Beans node for any EJB module project and choosing 
  New &gt; Session Bean.
<p>You set the following information in the wizard:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>EJB Name.</b> Set the name of the session bean in the deployment descriptors 
    and is the basis for the session bean's class and interface names.</li>
  <li><b>Location.</b> Select the source folder where you want to create the session 
    bean files.</li>
  <li><b>Package.</b> Select an existing package or type the name of a new package.</li>
  <li><b>Session Type.</b> Select one of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stateless.</b> The bean does not save state information during its 
        conversation with the user. These enterprise beans are useful for simple 
        interactions between client and application service, interactions that 
        are complete in a single method invocation. 
        <p>An example is an enterprise bean that processes orders. Each order 
          can be processed by an invocation of one method, such as <tt>processOrder()</tt>. 
          All the information needed for processing is contained in the method 
          parameters.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Stateful.</b> The bean saves state information during its conversation 
        with the user. These enterprise beans are useful for business processes 
        that require an interaction between client and application service that 
        lasts longer than a single method invocation and requires memory of the 
        state of the interaction. 
        <p>An example is an online shopping cart. The end user, through the client 
          program, can order a number of items. The stateful session bean managing 
          the interaction must accumulate items until the end user is ready to 
          review the accumulated order, approve or reject items, and initiate 
          processing of the lot. The stateful session bean has to store the unprocessed 
          items and enable the end user to add more.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Create Interface.</b> Specify which interfaces to create for the session 
    bean: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Remote.</b> Allow your session bean to be accessed from remote clients 
        using remote method calls. This usually means clients that are not running 
        on the session bean's application server.</li>
      <li><b>Local.</b> Allow your session bean to be accessed from clients that 
        are running in the same Java virtual machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
