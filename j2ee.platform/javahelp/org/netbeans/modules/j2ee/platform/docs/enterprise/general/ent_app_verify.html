<h2>Verifying an Enterprise Application</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>Before you deploy an enterprise application or any stand-alone web or EJB module 
  to the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, you should verify it, to ensure it 
  is properly implemented to the Java EE specification. The verifier tool validates 
  both Java EE and application server-specific deployment descriptors against their 
  corresponding DTD files and gives errors and warnings if a module or application 
  is not Java EE and Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish compliant. You can verify deployment 
  descriptors in EAR, WAR, RAR, and JAR files.</p>
<p>The verifier tool is not simply an XML syntax verifier. Rules and interdependencies 
  between various elements in the deployment descriptors are verified. Where needed, 
  classes in your module are examined to ensure that what is referred to in the
  deployment descriptors actually exists and will work when deployed. </p>
<p><b>To verify a project deployment descriptors:</b></p>
<ol>
	
  <li>Right-click any web application module, EJB module, or enterprise application 
    project in the Projects window and choose Verify. The target server for the 
    project must be the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish. 
    <p>The Verifier window opens and displays all the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Filter the results according to your needs: 
      <ul>
          <li>Click Failures Only to display only failures.</li>
          <li>Click Failures and Warnings Only to display only failures and warnings.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Make appropriate changes, if any, and verify the project again.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
  <li>Not all failures to comply with the Java EE specification will cause the 
  application to fail. However, modules that fail to comply with the specification
   may not be portable between application servers. The verifier tool helps you ensure your code is
    not locked into running only on a specific application server.</li>
