    <h2>About Building Web Services</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
    <p>In general, you build a web service implemented within a EJB module
    or a web application just as you would build any other 
    project. As with other projects, the IDE automatically detects whether a project is part of a J2EE application 
    and sets whether to package the archive files on the classpath accordingly. The 
    IDE does not package API libraries like the Servlet API in your EJB module JAR 
    file. You can adjust which archive files are packaged with your module in the 
    module project's Project Properties dialog box.</p>
    
    <p>However, for JAX-WS web services, the <tt>wsimport</tt> tool is run
    as part of the build process. For JAX-RPC web services, it is the <tt>wsimport</tt> tool
    tool that is run, instead.</p>
   

    <p><b>To build the web service:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do one of the following to build the web service:
        <ul>
            <li>If the module within which the web service is implemented
            is part of a J2EE application, make sure the J2EE application 
            is set as the main project and choose Build &gt; Build 
            Main Project (F11).</li>
            <li>If the project is a stand-alone module, or if you want to build the 
            module without building the other modules in the J2EE application, right-click 
            the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build Project.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Analyze the result and, if necessary, do the following:
        <ul><li>For JAX-WS web services, customize the <tt>wsimport</tt> tool's
            attributes, using the <a href="../csh/editor/EditWSAttributesCookieImpl.html">Web Service Attributes Editor</a>.
            <li>For JAX-RPC web services, customize the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool's features in
            the Project Properties dialog box, depending on your needs.
        </ul>
    </ol>
