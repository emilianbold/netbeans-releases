<h2>Enterprise Application Client Project Properties Dialog Box: Sources</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>The Sources panel enables you to view the location of the project folder, manage 
    source and test package folders, as well as set the source level of the packages 
    which the IDE will use. You open the Enterprise Application Client Project Properties 
dialog box by right-clicking any application client project and choosing Properties.</p> 
<p>The Configuration Files Folder property specifies the folder in which Java 
  EE deployment descriptors are stored. The standard location for deployment descriptors 
  is in the <tt>src/conf</tt> folder. </p>
<p>Use the buttons on the right side of the panel to add, remove, and change the 
  order of classpath elements. </p>
<p>You can have multiple source roots in a standard project, with the following 
  exceptions: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project. </li>
  <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the 
    same project. For example, a source root that is registered under Test Packages 
    cannot be added to the list of Source Packages. </li>
  <li>All of the source roots are packaged into the same JAR file and share the 
    same classpath. </li>
  <li>If you have a source root that needs to be used by several projects, you 
    should create a separate project for the source root and set up compilation 
    dependencies between the projects. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the Source/Binary Format combo box  
to set the lowest Java platform version with which the generated Java code should be 
compatible. This setting corresponds to the javac <tt>-source</tt> option. 
Setting the source/binary format helps prevent you from using Java language constructs 
that are not available in the platform version to which you want to deploy. 
However, setting the source/binary format does not ensure that the platform APIs 
are used compatibly with that platform version. To make sure that your application 
is fully compatible with an earlier Java platform version, you need to 
switch to the <a href="appclient_props_libraries.html">Libraries tab</a> 
and set the Java Platform setting to the minimum version on which you plan
to deploy.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>Specifying the source/binary format does not change the Java platform whose libraries 
    and executables are used to compile and run your project. To set the Java 
    platform that is used for compiling and running your project, click Libraries 
    and set the Java Platform setting accordingly. You cannot set the source/binary format 
    of a project to a higher release than the project's Java platform. </li>
</ul>
