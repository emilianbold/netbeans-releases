<h6>Java EE application server</h6>
<p>The runtime portion of a Java EE product combining a web server and an EJB server 
  into one server.</p>
<p> An EJB server provides services to an EJB container, which implements the 
  EJB component contract of the Java EE architecture. This contract specifies a runtime 
  environment for enterprise beans that includes security, concurrency, life-cycle 
  management, transaction, deployment, naming, and other services.</p>
<p> A web server provides services to access web pages, servlets, Java server 
  pages, and so on. It hosts web sites, provides support for HTTP and other protocols, 
  and executes server-side programs (such as CGI scripts or servlets). In the 
  Java EE architecture, a web server provides services like HTTP message handling 
  to a web container. A web server can host one or more web containers. </p>
