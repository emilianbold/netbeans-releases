        <p>Right-click the project and choose one of the 
        following: 
        <ul><li><b>Run Project.</b> Only takes the 
            minimal steps needed to run the project. For example, if you only changed one file,
            only that file is sent to the server.
        </li>
            <li><b>Deploy Project.</b> Undeploys and then deploys the complete module 
            no matter what changes you made, even if none.</li>
        </ul>
  

        <p>For web applications, unless the project in which the web service 
        client is implemented is designed to be deployed as a stand-alone application, you 
        should always deploy it by deploying the enterprise application that contains 
        it. If you run the Run Project or Deploy Project commands on an individual module 
        that is part of an enterprise application, the IDE only deploys that module 
        itself. Any changes you have made in the other modules in the project are not 
        propagated to the server.</p>

        <p><b>To deploy a client from within an enterprise application project:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects window, add the web application module
            to the enterprise application.</li>
            <li>Right-click the enterprise application project and choose one of the 
                following: 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Run Project.</b> Only takes the 
                    minimal steps needed to run the project. For example, if you only changed one file,
                    only that file is sent to the server.</li>
                    <li><b>Deploy Project.</b> Undeploys and then deploys the complete module 
                    no matter what changes you made, even if none.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
