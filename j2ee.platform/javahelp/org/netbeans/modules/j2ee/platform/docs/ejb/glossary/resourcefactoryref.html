<h6>resource  reference</h6>
<p>An external reference to a resource, such as a database connection, that must 
  be created by a resource factory to enable an enterprise bean to perform its work. The Java client or enterprise bean accesses the resource by making 
  a JNDI lookup when the client or bean is running. </p>
<p>Each resource  reference has a corresponding <tt>resource-ref</tt> 
  entry in the deployment descriptor.</p>
