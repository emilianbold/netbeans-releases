        <h2>Web Service Attributes Editor: Operation</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>In the WSIT tab's Operation section, on the service side, 
        you can add WSIT security to a specific web service operation.</p>
        
        <p>At times, you may need to configure different operations with
        different supporting tokens. You may wish to configuring security at the operation
        level, for example, in the situation where only one operation requires a
        UsernameToken to be passed and the rest of the operations do not require this, or
        in the situation where only one operation needs to be endorsed by a special token
        and the others do not.
       
        <p>In the Operation section of the WSIT configuration editor, you can select the following
        options for securing a web service operation:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Transaction.</b> Select an option from the Transactions list to specify a level
            at which transactions will be secured. For this release, transactions will
            only use SSL for security.
            <li><b>Secure This Operation.</b> Select this option to secure the web service operation.
            This option will be grayed out if Secure All Service Operations (in
            the PortBinding section) is selected because it would be redundant. Once
            selected, the list of security mechanisms is enabled.
            <li><b>Security Mechanism.</b> Select a security mechanism from the list. The security
            mechanisms are fully functional as selected. To customize the security
            mechanism, select the Configure button. For details on each
            security mechanism, see <a href="../about/wsitconf-about_security_mechanism_options.html">About Security Mechanism Options for Web Services</a>.
        </ul>
