<h2>Creating a Web Service from a WSDL File</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you and your business partners agree on a "contract" in the form of a WSDL file,
you can use the IDE to implement it. The WSDL file is an agreement on the data and  messages 
 that will be exchanged as well as how these messages will be sent and received. 
 In the IDE, you can use the WSDL file to implement the web service.</p>
 <p><b>To create a web service from a WSDL file:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Depending on the <a href="about_implement_ws.html">implementation form</a>, do one of the following:
<ul>
	<li><a href="../../web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="../../ejb/editing/create_ejb_project.html">Create an EJB module project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Later, you will not be able to <a href="../build/about_build_ws.html">build</a> the web service
	unless the SJS Application Server is the target
	 server for the project.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project node
and choose New <img src="../../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;Web Service.</li>
<p>The New Web Service wizard opens.</li>
<li>Type the web service name and specify a package to house the web service.</li>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Browse to a WSDL file on your filesystem.</li>
<li>Specify a URL to an online WSDL file.</li></ul>
<li>Click Finish.
<p>The IDE does the following:
<ul>
	
<li>A new WSDL file is created. The abstract portion is copied from the original file, 
while the concrete portion is "normalized" from the original.
For example, a <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#binding">binding element</a> is created if it did
not exist in the WSDL file. Also, the <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#binding">service element</a> is created to be compatible with
binding, and receives the web service name that you specified in the wizard, replacing the service element 
in the original WSDL file.</li>
<li>It creates the Service Endpoint Interface (the "interface"), which declares the web service's operations. 
In the IDE, the interface is identified by the suffix "SEI". For example, if you named your 
web service <tt>CalculatorWS</tt>, its interface is named <tt>CalculatorWSSEI</tt>.
The IDE automatically populates the interface with a declaration for each web service operation
 from the WSDL file.</li>
 <li>It creates the class for the implementation of the interface. The operations found
 in the WSDL file are added to this class.
In the IDE, an implementation class is identified by the suffix "Impl" (for web applications)
 or "Bean" (for EJB modules). For example, if your 
 web service is named <tt>CalculatorWS</tt>, its implementation class is named <tt>CalculatorWSImpl</tt>
 or <tt>CalculatorWSBean</tt>.</li></ul>
By default, both files are housed in a package within your project's <tt>src</tt> folder (in the Files window)
and you can access it in the Source Packages node (in the Projects window).
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Since the WSDL file governs the interface to the web service,
	you may <i>not</i> add new operations to web services that are created from a WSDL file, 
	because these operations will not be reflected back in the WSDL file.</td>
