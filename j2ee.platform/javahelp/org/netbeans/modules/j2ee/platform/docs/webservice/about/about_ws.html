        <h2>About Web Services</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>Web services are distributed application components that conform to standards 
            that make them externally available. They solve the problem of integrating diverse 
            computer applications that have been developed independently and run on a variety 
        of software and hardware platforms.</p>
        <P>The promise of web services architecture is to allow you to
        connect applications that were developed on different platforms and
        in different programming languages. This can only work if vendors can
        agree on common standards. 
        
        <p>The following web service programming models are supported
         by the IDE:
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>REpresentational State Transfer (REST).</b> Some JAX-WS web services can be described as being RESTful.
            REST is an architectural style. Elements of the REST archictectural style are its stateless client-server architecture
            and the fact that web services are viewed as resources that can be identified by their URLs. 
            The application of some or all of the constraints specified by the REST architectural style to 
            a JAX-WS web service makes it a RESTful web service. 
            
            <li><b>Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS).</b> This programming model
            relates specifically to Java EE 5. A follow-on release of Java API for XML-based RPC 1.1 (JAX-RPC), JAX-WS 
            simplifies the task of developing web services using Java technology. It addresses some of 
            the issues in JAX-RPC 1.1 by providing, for example, annotations to simplify web service 
            development and reduce the size of runtime JAR files.
            
            <li><b>Java API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC).</b> JAX-RPC is the 
            programming model for creating web services and
            clients in Java (not necessarily J2EE 1.4). The JSR 109 implementation facilitates the
            creation of JAX-RPC web services and clients in the J2EE 1.4 environment. For legacy reasons,
            the IDE continues to support JAX-RPC web services. 
            
            <ul class="note">
                <li>JAX-RPC web services, though supported in the IDE, are not described
            in this helpset, since you are assumed to be using JAX-WS web services instead,
            when beginning to create new web services in the IDE.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
        </ul> 
        
        <p>Both programming models are based on
        the following specifications:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><P><B>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).</B> Defines the
                mechanism by which a web service is called and how data is returned.
                For detailed information, refer to the SOAP 1.2 Specification. 
            </P>
            <LI><P><B>WSDL (Web Service Definition Language).</B> Describes the
                external interface of a web service. For detailed information, refer
                to the WSDL 1.1 Specification. 
            </P>
            <LI><P><B>UDDI (Universal Discovery, Description, and Integration).</B>
                Registries contain information about web services, including the
                location of WSDL files and the location of the running services. The
                IDE does not let you publish web services to or
                browse from a UDDI registry, although the WSDL files that you
            use can come from a variety of sources, including a UDDI registry.</P>
            <LI><P><B>JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding).</B>
                In contrast to JAX-RPC, that uses its own data binding
                facilities, JAX-WS delegates data binding related tasks
                to JAXB. The JAXB 2.0/2.1 specification is developed
                in parallel with JAX-WS 2.0/2.1.</P>
