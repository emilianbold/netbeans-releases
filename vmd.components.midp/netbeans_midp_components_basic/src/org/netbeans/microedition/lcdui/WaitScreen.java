/**
 * This component suits as a wait screen, which let the user to execute a blocking
 * background task (e.g. a network communication) and waits for it until finished.
 * <p/>
 * The background task is being started immediately prior the component is being
 * shown on the screen.
 * <p/>
 * When the background task is finished, this component calls commandAction method
 * on assigned CommandListener object. In the case of success, the commandAction method
 * is called with SUCCESS_COMMAND as parameter, in the case of failure, the commandAction
 * method is called with FAILURE_COMMAND as parameter.
 * <p/>
 * The functionality from previous version, where the component automatically swiches
 * to another <code>Displayable</code> objects is still available, but has beeen 
 * deprecated.
 * <p/>
 * The deprecated behavior is the following - in the case of success (i.e. the
 * task finished successfully), it switches to displayable(s) supplied by
 * <code>setNextDisplayable()</code> methods, in the case of failure, it switched to displaybles(s)
 * supplied by <code>setFailureDisplayable()</code> methods. In the case there is not
 * set failure displayable, <code>WaitScreen</code> even in the
 * case of failure switches to displayables specified by the <code>setNextDisplayable()</code>
 * method. In the case there is even no next displayable specified, after the
 * task is finished, <code>WaitScreen</code> switches back to the screen it was
 * previously visible on the display.
