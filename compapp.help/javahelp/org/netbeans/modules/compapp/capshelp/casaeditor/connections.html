<h2>Connecting Composite Application Components</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
The Design View of the CASA Editor displays composite application components and their connections. You can perform the following operations on connections between components:
<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Delete a Connection</b>
	<br>Select a component and press the Delete key. You can also right-click a component, and select Delete.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Add a Connection</b>
	<br>From either a Consume or Provide endpoint of a component, select the endpoint and drag it to a Provide or Consume endpoint on another component. If the connection satisfies all validation rules, the connection is created.
	<br><br><b>Note: </b>A provider endpoint can have multiple connections from multiple consumers, but a consumer endpoint can have only a single connection with a single provider. For example, if a WSDL binding is already connected to a provider, you have to first delete this connection before you can connect it to another provider.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>View or Modify the Properties of a Connection</b>
	<br>Select a component to view its properties in the Properties window. Use the Properties window to modify any of its properties.
	</li>
</ul>
