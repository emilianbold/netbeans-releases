DESC_Attribute_disableMessageID=<html>\
Enables or disables the auto-generation of message IDs on messages sent.<br.\
This only serves as a hint to the JMS provider; check with the provider you<br>\
are using to see if this is supported.</html>
DESC_Attribute_disableMessageTimeStamp=<html>\
Enables or disables the auto-generation of timestamps on messages sent. This <br>\
only serves as a hint to the JMS provider; check with the provider you are <br>\
using to see if this is supported.</html>
DESC_Attribute_timeout=<html>\
Sets the timeout waiting for a reply message; applies only<br>\
if the operation is an In-Out message exchange pattern</html>
DESC_Attribute_clientID=<html>\
Sets the unique client ID; if using a durable subscriber and this<br>\
is not set then the durableName will be used as the clientID</html>
DESC_Attribute_messageSelector=Defines the JMS message selector to use for message consumption
DESC_Attribute_subscriptionDurability=If true, and the destination is a Topic, creates a durable subscriber on that Topic
DESC_Attribute_subscriptionName=<html>\

(destination is a Topic and subscriptionDurability is set to true)</html>
DESC_Attribute_maxConcurrentConsumers=This element specifies the maximum number of concurrent receivers that can process messages.
DESC_Attribute_concurrencyMode=Specifies the concurrency mode. Note that there is no concurrent processing for Topics in sync mode.
DESC_Attribute_batchSize=<html>\
If defined with a positive integer, this attribute specifies that <br>\
the messages received will be batched. The actual number of messages<br>\
in the batch could be less than or equal to the specified size.</html>
DESC_Attribute_redeliveryHandling=<html>If defined, this attribute specifies what actions to take <br>\
in the event that an error occurred in processing the JMS message received from <br>\
the JMS destination (for example, putting the "poisoned" message in a dead letter queue). <br><br>\
   format := entry[; entry]*<br>\
   entry := idx ":" action<br>\
   idx := number (denotes the n-th time a msg was seen)<br>\
   action := number (denotes delay in ms) | "delete" | "move"(args)<br>\
   move := "queue"|"topic" | "same" ":" destname<br>\
   destname :=  any string, may include "$" which will be replaced with the original destination name.<br>\
<br>\
Example:<br>\
    5:1000; 10:5000; 50:move(queue:mydlq)<br>\
<br>\
This causes no delay up to the 5th delivery; a 1000 ms delay is invoked when the message is seen<br>\
 the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th time. A 5 second delay is invoked when the msg is invoked the <br>\
10th, 11th, ..., 49th time. When the msg is seen the 50th time the msg is moved to a queue with the name "mydlq".</html>
